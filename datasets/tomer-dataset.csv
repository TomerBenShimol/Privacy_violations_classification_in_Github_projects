For privacy reasons, let's switch to a form that posts the same information to the top of https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Mobile_app/Feedback  For logged-in users:  1. Show a form:  - 4-lines high text area where the user must write a custom message.  - Checkboxes for each line of debug information (for instance `API level: 30`, `Android version: 11`, etc). The user can unselect the debug information that will be sent. For instance, if the user does not want others to know that they are using a SM-G986B phone (for privacy reasons), they can uncheck the checkbox at the `Device model: SM-G986B` line. 2. Post the content as a new section at the top of https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Mobile_app/Feedback . Adding a new section to a wiki article is already implemented by the app in other places, such as peer review, so it should be rather easy to implement.  The probability of two users sending feedback at the exact same time is very low, but please just try to minimize the time between reading the content of the page and posting the updated content.  If the user is not logged in, just open the user's browser at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Mobile_app/Feedback (rationale: _once there the user will be able to add a new section, and will receive the WMF's official disclaimers regarding their confidentiality_)",1,
https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/20806,1118262580,Extend widget privacy information before accepting it,"### Your use case  #### What would you like to do? With https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/11262#issuecomment-554131235 we got the information about what data might get transmitted to a widget.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803622/151668583-c38b14cd-657f-43e4-9b8b-5ad524249e63.png)  I would like to see this extended for privacy concerns: 1. It would be good if this warning could determine in advance not what data could, but actually will be transmitted to the widget. 2. The warning says ""might transmit data to XY"", and store cookies. In above screenshot I tried adding several different widgets using a self hosted dimension integration manager. It will always say dimension, even if you embed a totally different page. With dev tools we can see that e.g. `""data.url"": ""https://framadate.org/somehashhere""`. I would like to be able to preview what actually is embedded based on the actual content that's loaded. (I'm not sure however, some of this might be specific to how dimension works.)  #### Why would you like to do it? 1. More fine grained control/expectation about what data you're willing to expose 2. Can decide if I want to share above info to that specific site. This is important because I might trust things hosted by my homeserver or reputable organizations, but not others. Further, this doesn't depend on the widget title being set and trusted to tell me what this is.  #### How would you like to achieve it? 1. Think similar to installing an app on android: This widget requires the following: mxid, roomid, etc. This might eventually need some spec about how to define those requirements. 2. Maybe just display said url field?  ### Have you considered any alternatives?  _No response_  ### Additional context  _No response_",0,

Thus, I'm asking for more detailed *positive* acknowledgements as to what data is collected in above panel. Suggestions for this include;  1. grabbing those definitions from [matrix-analytics-events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-analytics-events), and displaying these in this panel in a fashion (such as under a expansion dropdown) 2. prefixing ""negative"" acknowledgements with red/cross icons. 3. describing intentions, ""We will use data about the number of rooms you've joined to prioritise room performance optimisation, and provide the best average experience"". 4. providing a visual readout of the current live data, so that the user can double-check for themselves what data the local client is actually sending out. 5. in patch notes, include new types of data to be collected through analytics 6. provide toggles on a data-type basis for users to opt-in/out of specific analytics data.  Above is in decreasing order of suggested urgency, the main thing i want to get across is that the user is informed at any time as to what data is being collected from them, that they're able to keep up-to-date with this information, and that they have complete agency over this fact, plus their participation.  ---  (Copied verbatim from https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/110)",0,‰‡Ì†ÚˆÌ†‰ÚÂ·„‰†˘Ï‡†ÓÒÂÙ˜†ÓÒÙÈ˜†ÓÈ„Ú†≠æ†‰Ù¯˙†Ù¯ËÈÂ˙ø

Fix this privacy issue by returning an empty list in case `shareapi_allow_share_dialog_user_enumeration` is unset or `shareapi_restrict_user_enumeration_to_group` is set.  In the long run, we might want to return users from common groups if `shareapi_restrict_user_enumeration_to_group` is set. It's complicated to implement this in a way that scales, though.

When `gas` is omitted the expected `from` value is present on the private transaction receipt.  ### Acceptance Criteria `from` value on the private transaction receipt should match the `from` on the private transaction. This value is not expected to change with the `gasLimit`.  ### Steps to Reproduce (Bug) 1. Run Besu (v20.10.4) with the following config: ```       /opt/besu/bin/besu public-key export --to=/tmp/bootnode_pubkey;       /opt/besu/bin/besu \       --config-file=/config/config.toml \       --p2p-host=$$(hostname -i) \       --genesis-file=/config/genesis.json \       --node-private-key-file=/opt/besu/keys/key \       --min-gas-price=0 \       --privacy-enabled \       --privacy-url=$${ORION_CLIENTURL} \       --privacy-public-key-file=/config/orion/orion.pub \       --privacy-onchain-groups-enabled=false \       --rpc-http-api=EEA,WEB3,ETH,NET,PRIV,PERM,IBFT \       --rpc-ws-api=EEA,WEB3,ETH,NET,PRIV,PERM,IBFT ; ```  2. Send a transaction with `gas` set to a value (eg. 900000). 3. Retrieve the private transaction receipt. 4. Send a transaction with `gas` omitted. 5. Retrieve the private transaction receipt.  **Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen] The `from` value on both receipts should be the same.  **Actual behavior:** [What actually happens] The `from` value on the transaction without gas has the expected value, the `from` value on the transaction with gas has an unexpected value.

https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/685,983218899,[Requirements] Data Retention Requirements,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.  With MDS 1.2 and the Requirements API, it is possible for the first time for Agencies to specify which data they need,⁄ and which data should not be shared. This is a major step forward for Data Minimization by allowing for the creation of best practices and example Requirements files that describe how to make minimal data requests for common use cases.  A related step I'd love to see MDS take is to describe data retention practices. This could cover some or all of the following capabilities: - Allowing Agencies to specify a minimum duration for data retained on operators' systems - Allowing Agencies to specify a maximum duration for data retained on their own (or a chosen aggregators') systems - Allowing operators to specify a maximum duration that they retain data _and/or_ - Allowing Agencies to specify a maximum duration for data retained on operators' systems  These requirements could be expressed at the API, endpoint and perhaps even the field level. Here are some example use cases: - An agency specifies that they require status events to be retained by operators (ie queryable) for at least 6 months - An agency specifies that they will hold onto metrics data for up to five years, but will only hold onto disaggregate trip data for 1 month. - An agency interested in trying [Geography Driven Events](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/blob/main/general-information.md#geography-driven-events) specifies that they will hold onto GDE event data for up to one year, and they will hold onto full event data for one month (to allow for the verification and evaluation of GDE data).  _A note on aggregate data_ My intention with this issue is to allow for explicit requirements around the retention of _raw_ (particularly sensitive) data being delivered via MDS. This seemed like a good place to draw the line for now, but aggregate data can also sometimes be sensitive. It's an open, related question whether and how MDS might someday attempt to describe the retention of data that has been aggregated, analyzed etc.   ### Describe the solution you'd like  I'm imagining this as an extension to the Requirements API.  ### Is this a breaking change  Probably, insofar as it might allow for the creation of breaking requirements on operator implementations. Possibly this could be avoided with a conditional period, as we allowed for with Requirements in 1.2.  ### Impacted Spec  For which spec is this feature being requested?   * `requirements`  ### Additional context  See also the #608 and #646.

The ideal scenario would be that, when running on public networks, none of the private tx logic would be ever in the code execution path.  See https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/2606 for context  - [ ] add more tests that utilise chainId of 1 (mainnet) - need to make sure tests are totally isolated from Mainnet - [ ] maybe we need a GoQuorumTransactionValidator - similar idea to GoQuorumBlockProcessor - instead of having code in MainnetTransactionValidator - [ ] ensure sufficient testing - acceptance tests  Problem The scope of this problem is limited to: Value transfer public transactions received via JSON-RPC Value transfer public transactions received via DevP2P When receiving a value transfer tx via JSON-RPC, Besu was considering it a private tx and enforcing a validity check that prevents private transactions from transferring value. That's why it was returning the error message ether value is not supported for private transactions. When receiving value transfer tx via DevP2P, Besu was considering those transactions invalid, not propagating them further. Luckily, the logic for block validation and import wasn't using the same code path. This means that Besu would still successfully synchronise with Mainnet and be up-to-date. This bug won't cause a fork. It is worth mentioning that this bug was caused by a specific combination of factors, related to the chainId value being 1.

Currently, there is no private consensus to prevent this from happening. As such, there is the possibility for nodes to have inconsistent states.   ### Implementation  On the `PrivacyPluginService` a method has been added to allow registration of a `PrivacyGroupGenesisProvider`.  The provider must return a `PrivacyGenesis`. This currently only allows you to define genesis accounts/allocs.  ",0,

https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/besu/issues/2387,915254883,Besu + Private transaction manager Performance problems,"HI  At @iobuilders we are working with several clients, including Allfunds (on their custom transaction manager). On out latest smart contract set, we are using structs as params, return value, arrays etc. with the new abiencoderv2  We use pragma solidity ^0.7.5; pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;  We use a standard hyperledger besu network, with maxContractSize to 48k, because our main contract are around 38kb. (4gb 2vcpus, 4 validators, 2 regular nodes)  Deploying smart contracts at the public state works perfectly fine. Once we deploy de same smart contract, and do the same transactions on the privacy group, and private state level, performance bottlenecks appears, increasing the heap consumption for one single rpc call ( not tx ) to 3GB. Added to rocks db thread blocked traces  Having similar issues in the past with public state, and having reported rocks db performance issues in the past(https://pegasys1.atlassian.net/browse/PAN-3245?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYTUxYTI2MDQ3MTZkNDY2NGIwZTNjZTU4MjcxNmFlMWEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9), having known that private state has no log bloom cache, our guess and feeling, is that:  - Private state performance for complex SC and transactions needs to be tuned - Root cause could be state read at rocks db level, and no cache existence  Can you help us, give support on this?  Does the new tessera based implementation focus on this perfomance, cache topic?

https://api.github.com/repos/infoderm/patients/issues/276,896447935,Warn when multiple tabs edit the same patient or consultation,"Should be generic enough that it can be extended to anything.  A robust idea would be to have a editing collection that keeps track of `{userId, itemCollection, itemId}`. This would allow anybody to see what others are editing. Should evaluate whether this is OK as long as itemCollection and itemId do not leak any information other than an editing histogram. This would also allow to display a list of items currently open for edition.  An extension of this idea would be to enforce `{itemCollection, itemId, owner}` constraints when querying this new collection. Maybe it would be better to implement a proper permissions system. A scalable solution is again a similar idea as above where we store either `{userId, permission, itemCollection, itemId}` or `{userId, read, write, itemCollection, itemId}` if the only permissions are `read` and `write`. These solutions seems nice since we will mostly run permission testing code on the server. The only occasions where we might need testing on the client is for UX considerations (like hiding an edit button). With the first solution we would query `find({userId: this.userId, permission: 'write'})` and the second solution `find({userId: this.userId, write: 'true'})` with appropriate indices for uniqueness and search performance.  NOTE: should write imply read? ",0,

https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/640,864402964,Carshare Support,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.  Background:  Ride Report is working with a variety of carshare operators on MDS and is looking to develop the spec to support carshare specific use cases we have identified.   **Use Cases:**  - **Flexible Rates:** Carshare rentals allow users to rent vehicles by the minute, hour, or by days. Currently, MDS Provider shows vehicle rental per minute and API consumers are unable to differentiate between users who selected per minute pricing vs. per day vs. per hour. - **Fleet Info:** Carshare providers utilize a variety of makes and models of cars. From sedans to SUVs, from ICE vehicles to electric or hybrid powertrains. All the vehicles have different cargo and passenger capacities. It would be helpful to get a snapshot of a providers fleet mix breakdown, to evaluate the type of vehicles people are utilizing. - **Service Area Exit:** The carshare mode inherently offers shared mobility users flexibility to take different length (distance, duration) trips. It would be helpful to get some sort of data about a trip when it exits the service area in privacy preserving manner. Are cars going far away? Are cars going out of the larger metro area? Are cars going out-of-state? - **Vehicle Idle Time:** Cars sit idle and take up a substantial amount of space. Cities would like to know how long cars sit idle on the PROW for a variety of reasons: to understand utilization, pricing, loss parking revenue, etc. With MDS Provider we can measure how long a vehicle is sitting based on the `unavailable` vehicle state, however with carshare a user can rent a vehicle for up to a week at a time and there is no state representing a reserved vehicle that is parked. - **Other Vehicle Data:** Odometer data to aid in accuracy of trip metrics and routing. - **Policy:** new Policy capabilities that are specific to car share, like parking parking Policy that refers to specific signage (i.e. 2hr zones) instead of just geofences.   ### Describe the solution you'd like  TBD, We are working on a more formal technical proposal.   ### Is this a breaking change   * I'm not sure, but this will become more clear as we determine the technical solution.   ### Impacted Spec  For which spec is this feature being requested?   * `provider`  * `policy`    ",0,

Thank you very much in advance community!   - [x] Confirm behaviour is inconsistent with public transaction behaviour  - [ ] Document current behaviour as a known issue - [ ] (longer term) If yes, fix.

Please describe.  Several cities are inquiring about crash data. We have been supporting them in linking this data with street usage and existing infrastructure. Crash data are today issued from manual reporting at hospitals. It provides timestamp, location and type of vehicles. This data however is not of high quality, and it is difficult to make meaningful statistics out of it and hence support decision-making on infrastructure or policies.   ### Describe the solution you'd like  I believe it could be valuable to add this to the `/status_changes` endpoint. For example, I would see a transition from `on_trip` to `unavailable` with `event_type` = `accident/crash`.  I don't know to which extent providers can obtain this information ""live"". Clearly a survey just after a crash is difficult. Some providers have reporting process through the website. I wonder whether the (next generation) vehicles are (will be) able to detect crash with accelerometer & speed data. A good question to operators.  Ideally this would be part of the `/status_changes` endpoint. However we could also imagine a separate reporting but it may add complexity.     Today, this would be very useful as historical data to get analytics on crash for shared micro-mobility and link it to street segment. However, tomorrow, in a broader context, I believe this is a great step for connected vehicles to report 'live' crash to roadway authorities and emergency services.   ### Is this a breaking change  I don't believe this is breaking.   ### Impacted Spec  Provider  ### Describe alternatives you've considered  An alternative could again be separate monthly reporting in csv by providers where we would see the number of crashes. However this would be left to goodwill reporting by users & providers.   ",1,

https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/608,768376981,[Requirements] Ability to express data sharing requirements in Policy,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.  It has come up in a number of contexts that it would be useful to allow agencies to express data sharing requirements in MDS. I'm probably forgetting a few use cases, but here are some I have heard:  - In #607, allow agencies to state which geographies they would like aggregate metrics or reports for - In #507, allow certain fields or endpoints to become ""optional"" in the sense of not being required by the spec, but still allow them to be ""required"" in the sense of the city explicitly requiring them of providers - In #503, allow agencies to explicitly opt int to new optional or beta endpoints - In #585, allow agencies to invite transparency and public accountability around the data they collect and why - Improve data security by allowing operators to allocate access properly so that a city that does not request a given field/endpoint does not in fact have access to it - Improve system efficiency by allowing operators to know in advance which fields/endpoints need to be stored and/or computed in advance  ### Describe the solution you'd like  I think of MDS Policy as the digital representation of a City's mobility program policies ‚_“⁄ we are digitalizing their program PDF, in a sense. Data sharing requirements, including the requirement to provide MDS, are common in nearly any such policy. Hence, I think this belongs in MDS and in Policy specifically. One possibility that might meet some of the uses cases above would be adding a new rule type or set of rule types within the Policy endpoint that describe a city data sharing need.  ### Is this a breaking change  I think this could probably be done in a non-breaking way.  ### Impacted Spec  Policy.  ### Describe alternatives you've considered  There has also been discussion of this living in a new endpoint. I'm open to that, but I like the simplicity of having a single (public!) endpoint return everything about a city's policy. In addition, there are often direct relationships between rules and data sharing needs (cities need data to assess compliance with a rule). I think these relationships might be made more clear and explicit through a carefully considered augmentation of MDS Policy. ",0,

https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/585,718437299,Make Policy/Geography API Endpoints Optionally Public,"## Explain pull request  The value of having Policy API endpoints be public has come up in several different contexts. In particular, in the development of #503, it has been pointed out that a hypothetical ""bad actor"" at a city could create arbitrarily small or specific Policy regions that undermine the stated goal of protecting rider privacy. For example, this bad actor could create policy regions around a political protest and the home of a specific individual and receive events that reveal the trips of this individual to/from a protest. In this hypothetical example, the value of a public Policy API endpoint is clear: anyone could see what is happening and ask the bad actor to account for creating such targeted policy regions.  In less specific and hypothetical cases, there is public benefit from making Policy data ""open data"". For example, residents could monitor the vehicle caps over time and enterprising developers could add speed limits and no parking zones to their apps.  This change may raise concerns that vehicle caps and other such data are proprietary data. There may be competitive concerns here, but I don't think they should overrule the public benefit of publishing this data. There are no individual privacy concerns or trade secrets in this data, and it is unlikely that cities could shield this data from a records request.  ## Is this a breaking change  No.  ## Impacted Spec  Policy.

There is a MultiTenancyPrivacyController class that implements the checks.  When pantheon privacy is used the check includes a call to enclave.retrievePrivacyGroup that retrieves the members of the privacy group, in the case of on-chain privacy checking membership is done with a call to the privacy groups management contract to get the participants of the privacy group.  One example: Eea_sendRawTransaction will do multiple checks: One check in the class itself. When validating the private transaction, group membership is checked twice, once in the method itself, and once when determining the nonce.  The greatest number of group memberships checks happen when a new participant is added to an on-chain group and group membership is checked for each private transaction that is added to the data blob that is sent to the new participant.

Trip data is useful for many reasons, including for planning and research purposes, such as those expressed in #136.  Trip data however carries a risk, as described in the Chicago TNP and Taxi Open Data Approach: ‚_úIt†has†been†recognized†in†scientific†literature†and†news†reports†that†even†data†without†directly†identifying†attributes†can†be†reidentified†using†other†data†sourcesÆ†Specifically¨†data†about†an†individual‚__s†location†at†certain†points†in†time†can†create†a†‚__fingerprint‚__†that†can†allow†for†re†identification¨†as†long†as†there†is†a†separate†dataset†available†containing†parts†of†the†fingerprint†along†with†identifying†fieldsÆ‚_ù†††By†design¨†MDS†data†does†not†include†rider†characteristics¨†eÆgÆ†rider‚__s†name¨†date†of†birth¨†zip†code¨†phone†number¨†gender†identification¨†or†any†other†attribute†related†to†the†individualÆ†The†exception†is†the†location†and†time†of†the†trip†related†events¨†and†in≠trip†route†trace†telemetryÆ††To†further†protect†against†re-identification of MDS data, LADOT is implementing a similar approach to the one outlined and used by Chicago for TNP and Taxi, and micromobility trip data. Here we propose a [Trip Binning approach](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/files/5165535/OMF_.Trip.Deidentification.Binning.Spec.pdf) to further de-identified trip data and a new API to support serving it.  ### Describe the solution you'd like  Following the example of the submitted Metrics API #485, we propose a new de-identified trips API that could be implemented by either mobility Providers or regulating Agencies (based on data obtained from the Provider or Agency <code>/trips</code> endpoint).  The single endpoint would be something like <code>/trips/deidentified</code> with a variety of search parameters.  The API would contain precise definitions for further de-identified trips.  It could provide either private exchange between Providers and Agencies, or between either of those and more public feeds for e.g. academic researchers.  ### Is this a breaking change   * No, not breaking   ### Impacted Spec   * `agency`  * `provider`  ### Describe alternatives you've considered  We considered having one <code>/trips</code> endpoint that has different permissions and scope whether to serve the granular or further de-identified trip information. We went with separating <code>/trips</code> from <code>/trips/deidentified</code> to create clear delineation between granular and further de-identified trip information.   In regards to methodologies to de-identify trip information, [cities](https://github.com/louisvillemetro-innovation/Dockless-Open-Data#cities-with-dockless-trip-open-data) have taken different approaches whether through rounding the start and end location to broader geography, binning the time to a larger time interval, and/or applying k-anonymization. We went with a de-identification technique that puts forward the best aspects of these different approaches.  We tested approaches that go beyond spatial and temporal rounding, such as using k-anonymization methodologies, namely, Trip Binning, which originated from the City of Chicago, and [Point Fuzzing](https://github.com/louisvillemetro-innovation/Dockless-Open-Data#dockless-open-data) by Louisville. The result of the [comparison study here](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/files/5165534/OMF_.Anonymization.Methods.Comparison.pdf).   ### Additional context I'd welcome suggestions for better naming for <code>/trips/deidentified</code>.  Special thanks to @schnuerle for developing the Point Fuzzing technique, and providing input to the comparison study, @nicklucius for developing the Trip Binning approach for Chicago, and @whereissean, @playground-julia, Sam Jackson who kickstarted and have been relentless in developing a standard for trip deidentification.

https://api.github.com/repos/Automattic/jetpack/issues/17007,687920398,Mark some debug data as private in Site Health,"Jetpack makes great use of the Site Health component in WordPress core, but some of the information it provides is not ideal for public sharing.  This is fine when a Jetpack user looks for Jetpack support, and they can then be directed to post it privately, or informed of what might be considered sensitive, but if they are looking for help from another plugin or theme, they won't have this information up front.  The information that shouldn't be shared publicly that is very obvious to me: - `master_user` - `current_user` - `HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP` - `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` - `REMOTE_ADDR`  The users contain both a username and an email address, since a public posting of emails on WordPress.org is discouraged by the guidelines there, even though an email address in it self isn't security related, this should probably be marked as private.  There may be other items I'm not familiar with that could be considered private, but I'm not familiar enough with the data here to know what they might be, but this ticket would serve as a great place to outline what fields that may be if any.  The IP addresses, although not a very private matter by them selves, if the wrong person reveals their address, that information may be used by those with ill intent.  #### Describe the solution you'd like Implementing the `private => true` flag on sensitive data fields will keep it away from the easy copy-paste interface, and the users would need to provide that information manually (if Jetpack needs that info, it adds a small hurdle, but given the size of the ecosystem, it would be an overall win).",1,
https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/569,686840331,Special groups aggregate metrics,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.  Cities often request data on how many lower income users we reach with our vehicle service, and how many trips such users take. MDS does not currently support user segmentation. We would oppose attaching any user data to the Trips endpoint as it would involve information close to Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and would make it fairly easy to identify individuals by trip route and user segment. Instead, we propose the  solution of providing aggregate trip data by user segment.  ### Describe the solution you'd like  We propose that Providers provide aggregated data on trips by special user segments, using the new [Metrics API](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/486). By using aggregation, it should be impossible to trace back this data to individuals. This does mean we need to set meaningful minimals for certain metrics so that the aggregated data has k-anonymity.  The new Metrics API specifies parameters for name, since, interval, dimensions that we will assume these metrics support.  ### Proposed metrics for special groups:  |Metric | Description| |-- | --| | special_groups | array of names of special groups as served by Provider. This list will be fairly static. Example values are low_income or students | | active_users[special_group] | total number of users for given group with at least 1 trip in interval | | trips[special_group] | count of trips by users of given special group during interval | | trips.average_duration[special_group] | average duration in seconds of trips by users of given special group during interval | | trips.median_duration[special_group] | median duration in seconds of trips by users of given special group during interval | | trips.std_duration[special_group] | standard deviation of duration⁄ †in seconds of trips by users of given special group during interval | | trips.average_distance[special_group] | average distance in meters of trips by users of given special group†during interval | | trips.median_distance[special_group] | median distance in meters of trips by users of given special group during interval | | trips.std_distance[special_group] | standard deviation of distance in meters of trips by users of given special group during interval |   ### Overall aggregate statistics For overall usage we can do what is listed below. Please note that this data should be derivable from MDS trip data, minus active users.  | Metric | Description | | -- | -- | | active_users | total number of all users with at least 1 trip in interval | | trips | count of trips by all users during interval | | trips.average_duration | average duration in seconds of trips by all users⁄ †group during interval | | trips.median_duration | median duration in seconds of trips by all users⁄ †during interval | | trips.std_duration | standard deviation of duration in seconds of trips by all users⁄ †during interval | | trips.average_distance | average distance in meters of trips by all users⁄ †during interval | | trips.median_distance | median distance in meters of trips by all users⁄ †during interval | | trips.std_distance | standard deviation of distance in meters of trips by all users⁄ †during interval |    ### Is this a breaking change  A breaking change would require consumers or implementors of the API to modify their code for it to continue to function (ex: renaming of a required field or the change in data type of an existing field). A non-breaking change would allow existing code to continue to function (ex: addition of an optional field or the creation of a new optional endpoint).    * No, not breaking  ### Impacted Spec  For which spec is this feature being requested?   * `metrics` but only served by Providers. Only Providers will have the raw data  ### Describe alternatives you've considered  Alternatives would be to add user segments to individual trips in the Trips API. We oppose this method as it would make user identification extremely easy. We currently send this data to cities via manually compiled Excel sheets, and it would be better to have an official API.

https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse/vorto/issues/2566,686283090,Possible leakage of Vorto user e-mail addresses,"There is an old potential leak of Vorto users' e-mail addresses through the `/rest/accounts/{username:.+}` GET endpoint in the `AccountController`, that has never been intercepted.   The endpoint only requires authentication as pre-authorization, and with any valid username, will return a payload consisting in the username, but also some more sensitive data such as e-mail address or name of the authentication provider.   The endpoint is used in many front-end controllers, but it seems the e-mail address (by far, the _most_ sensitive bit of information) is only retrieved in the account settings, i.e. to display the e-mail address of the logged-on user, if they have set it themselves.   The second sensitive bit of information - the authentication provider - is displayed in the namespace request access form when parametrized with a user's name. While this is in fact technically a leakage (and a new one, compared to the rest), it has very little value as is, and might not be resolvable.   While this leak has been there forever, it is slightly aggravated by the recent implementation of search combo-boxes for users, which could potentially be employed to brute-force a list of Vorto usernames out for any authenticated user bothering to do so.  ----    I think a good compromise would be to suppress any sensitive data from the payload returned by GET `/rest/accounts/{username:.+}`, except when the authenticated username matches the `{username:.+}` path variable.  That should not break other usages of the endpoint.   Minor leakages, include retrieving namespace collaborators' authentication provider (but not e-mail) when managing the collaborators for a given namespace. As they are queriable by REST and pre-authorize with any authenticated user, they could also be subject to an additional authorization check to verify the calling user has the `namespace_admin` role on the given namespace.   # TL;DR  - Suppress e-mail and authentication provider from user retrieved through GET `/rest/accounts/{username:.+}` if `username` path variable does not match calling user's name - Make retrieval of namespace collaborators with GET `/rest/namespaces/{namespace:.+}/users`available only to calling users who have the `namespace_admin` role on the namespace.  @t-gauss @kolotu thoughts?

https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/14570,659024052,"Suggestion/discussion: E2E practicability in social rooms / missing ""Enable URL previews by default"" for E2E rooms setting and its impact","Sorry that I am proposing this in such an essay, but I am expecting this to be somewhat controversial but it is somewhat important to me:  Currently, I feel like there is a somewhat notable incentive to never enable E2E for any social non-super-private rooms if non-techies are in it.  That makes me sad, I want encryption to be everywhere where it is practical, and it feels like here it could also be with minor changes.  The reason social hangouts clash with E2E is that the link preview will automatically be broken with `""Enable URL previews by default for participants in this room""` unavailable/forced off. And I get that it'd default to Off, but it being entirely unchangeable for room admins poses a problem: some rooms are just fun social hang outs, and if regular users (like, imagine WhatsApp crowd coming over, and shouldn't that be great?) need to poke in the settings for such a basic feature, some users will likely just move on. And you can blame or not blame them for that, but the result is that it makes an E2E setup way less practical for more casual non-techie social rooms.  And here I get you could argue why even enable E2E then? Also, wouldn't letting room admins mess with this default risk security-conscious people unintentionally exposing themselves to a spying homeserver? Obviously it's a trade-off, but maybe think of it like this: it's still more secure to have an E2E room where link previews are enabled for regular unaware users by default (which they can still opt-out of!) than to have an unencrypted room entirely. And if gif previews are always, unchangeably opt-in even for fun social rooms, the truth is just many of these places won't enable E2E which is a total loss of security in numbers. It turns enabling E2E for a room admin from a no-brainer (outside of corner cases like bridges) to a difficult decision in some cases.  I am therefore proposing the following combined changes for discussion to balance this difficult situation:  - Step 1: Reintroduce `Enable URL previews by default for participants in this room`  for room admins of encrypted rooms, but default it to off - Step 2: Introduce a new user setting `Override URL preview in encrypted rooms to off, no matter the room's default` that defaults to off  And yes, I realize more settings is bad, and some people will miss both the per-channel opt-out and the new global opt-out and have links leaked when they thought they wouldn't be. I do realize many security hardliners will not like this. But I hope that you find it worth at least debating, in a possible future where hopefully E2E can reach everyone and their families, and security-conscious people can still find themselves at least somewhat sufficiently empowered to deviate and override to the defaults they want if they don't like how things are set by default. And I agree this isn't ideal, but neither does the current situation seem to be.  I am looking forward to your input!",0,

https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/besu/issues/1201,652853697,Add best-effort check for Orion version during startup,"### Description From Besu 1.5, to use private transactions it will be required to use Orion 1.6+ version. With the introduction of the `/version` endpoint in Orion (https://github.com/PegaSysEng/orion/issues/349), we can add an extra check during Besu startup to check if Orion has got the minimum version.  However, because it isn't a requirement that Orion is up and running at Besu startup, this should be a best-effort check. If we can't communicate with Orion during startup we shouldn't in any matter impact Besu startup.  ### Acceptance Criteria * When starting Besu 1.5+, if Orion is online and available, but it doesn't have the `/version` endpoint (pre-1.6 version) we will print a WARN log message about it. * When starting Besu 1.5+, if Orion is offline, Besu will print a WARN log msg about not being able to communicate with Orion. * When starting Besu 1.5+, if Orion is online and available and it has the `/version` endpoint (post-1.6 version) we will print an INFO log message about successfully talking to Orion and what version we are talking to.",0,

This is different from the public state, where if a transaction fails validation, the block is deemed invalid, and rejected.  For example, it is possible for 2 private transactions, from the same sender, in the same privacy group to have the same nonce - the first transaction will be executed and produce a receipt - the second however will fail ""pre"" validation (due to illegal nonce), and will not produce a receipt. Queries for the transaction receipt will turn up empty - rather than showing the error. It should be noted, TransactionReceipts do not support the idea of reporting ""illegal nonce"" - as that would invalidate a block in the public world (rather than producing a failing receipt).",0,

https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/14063,640368788,riot transmits video and audio in one direction from a text chat,"### Description  I was speaking to someone running riot on Mac. Part way through the conversation we paused while they accepted an upgrade that riot was offering  I had a few issues with the network connection yesterday. I rebooted the PC and attempted a video call which appeared to not connect then hung up. Next I started typing in the chat. The riot user interface displayed neither audio or nor video call, just a text chat. I could not hear or see the other party, but they could hear and see me!!! They typed into the chat what I was saying.  An update was pushed yesterday (riot-web: 1.6.5) and it might have something to do with this bug.  It is unnerving as it means that riot at the moment may transmit audio and video to the other side without giving any signs that it is doing so. This is not as bad as leaking it out to third party but is none the less a serious malfunction.  Am not sure if this is a bug which has been dormant a long time which has suddenly been activated by some network problems at my end but it is more likely that the recent release did it.  Another possibility is that, just before it occurred I had switched from an ethernet to a wifi connection, maybe that confused riot an triggered this behaviour.  Would not know if this can be reproduced, is the first time it has occurred and have been using riot for a while now.  If you need my logs - please tell me how to view the log files, I want to view them before supplying them.   ### Version Information  my system: riot-web: 1.6.4 and olm: 3.1.3 on Debian 10 other party: riot-web: 1.6.5 .

I also experienced similar behavior of other search engines, too.  ### Relevance This is relevant for many Nextcloud-installations, that do not want do be indexed at all. And especially those instances dealing with many users, that are **publicly** sharing files, polls, calendars etc., but do not know, their content will be indexed by search engines.  ### Solution Certainly this is fixable by simply adding the tag-code to the header. But this would have to be redone with future updates and reimplementation will most likely be forgotten. So I would love to see the functionality to edit noindex via meta or X-Robots-tag in a configuration-file.  Please take this feature into consideration. What do you think about this idea?",,

https://api.github.com/repos/ConsenSys/orion/issues/378,630339369,Change WARN logs for Payload not found,"When a client calls `/receive` with a key for a payload that doesn't exit in Orion, a WARN log message is generated. This has caused a lot of confusion in the past because it looks like something is wrong. But this is expected behaviour and the application is doing exactly what it is expected from it.  We should probably only log a TRACE msg when this happens. For the eventual scenario that we want to know exactly what happened with a specific request.  The biggest problem here is that these are messages generated on the `LoggerHandlerImpl`. So we need to check the code to find out how to make this change happen.

https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/507,625866326,Method to Exclude some Provider Fields from Response,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.  It is possible that cities or third parties may not want or need certain fields returned.  ### Describe the solution you'd like  Add an option through the API request that allows some fields to be removed from the response.  An example solution could be the inclusion of a new parameter, e.g. `exclude`, that could have a list of fields the city does not want to have returned in the response.  If a city didn‚__t want trips, then they can add `/trips?exclude=route` to the API call.  If they don‚__t want trip or fee data, they could add `/trips?exclude=route,standard_cost,actual_cost`.  This list of possible options can be defined in the spec.  Not sure if the resulting fields would be completely removed, or be returned empty, or with a special value.  I prefer the first option.  This also has a benefit of getting only the data you need for the task at hand, reducing the returned data file size, and reducing processing on the provider‚__s side.    ### Is this a breaking change  A breaking change would require consumers or implementors of the API to modify their code for it to continue to function (ex: renaming of a required field or the change in data type of an existing field). A non-breaking change would allow existing code to continue to function (ex: addition of an optional field or the creation of a new optional endpoint).    * Yes, breaking  ### Impacted Spec  For which spec is this feature being requested?   * `provider` - for now let's just focus on Provider  ### Describe alternatives you've considered  This is a proposed solution and discussion point to PR #504.  ### Additional context  I have seen this in other APIs, so there is some precedent here.

Additionally, `gas`, `gasPrice`, `nonce`, and `value` should be hex strings (`QUANTITY` as defined at https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactionbyhash).  ### Additional Information ```js // transaction {       blockHash: '0x9d42136b0c618be8e21b84f7e61b92969857abb2ef3573fac40af8f6fa8cee38',       blockNumber: 2, // <--       from: '0x86a256414b2f68FF0Cfa3645B4224AcB614a758B',       gas: 3000000, // <--       gasPrice: '0', // <--       hash: '0xe1c59bb3cfd45f2cd006b4f0c9504286f421acba30d9ba4f3558fff3ec8843b3',       input: '0xfbb3448cab99d2a23e7b43e2383b522401c183cc301b6e6353b034e46818fc12',       nonce: 0, // <--       to: '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000007E',       transactionIndex: 0, // <--       value: '0', // <--       v: '0x1c',       r: '0x25ede8e90b37e23f2276ab30badf04cbfe78789a1ee5093908e6fccbf2239da1',       s: '0x383abbb742b4d4000282268dda1bdcc375110c16b1d8d0402974e9cd1393d2ba' } ```  ```js // receipt {       contractAddress: '0x1c38fffca7ecd2ec8053fd4d5e50a422c8a4c314',       from: '0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73',       output: '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',       commitmentHash: '0xe1c59bb3cfd45f2cd006b4f0c9504286f421acba30d9ba4f3558fff3ec8843b3',       transactionHash: '0x78c19cb83792154a5ee82813970f0591a104b79d77321f2da9dd7ae7bb47e5c6',       privateFrom: 'A1aVtMxLCUHmBVHXoZzzBgPbW/wj5axDpW9X8l91SGo=',       privacyGroupId: 'iPMgA9PzaY1QUYbs6pofvNkUQGYRGoj9J094WV158nU=',       status: '0x1',       logs: [],       logsBloom: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',       blockHash: '0x9d42136b0c618be8e21b84f7e61b92969857abb2ef3573fac40af8f6fa8cee38',       blockNumber: '0x2', // <-- hex       transactionIndex: '0x0' // <-- hex } ```",,

https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/485,607778044,Add an MDS Metrics API,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.  There is currently no standard way to retrieve metrics calculated from MDS data (`provider` or `agency`) or to define a standard set of useful MDS-based data aggregations.⁄ †We have heard from the OMF community that this leads to a number of problems:  - Cities need a number of clearly defined best practice metrics for operating, measuring, and managing emerging micro-mobility, and other transportation programs using MDS data. - There is currently no standard counting methodology that mobility providers and cities have agreed upon. This consequently causes friction when establishing a new mobility program and evaluating its impact. - Cities need to rely upon trusted data sources upon which to perform longer term studies on citizen impact. - Mobility providers need consistent rules and measures between city deployments in order to make their operations more scalable.   ### Describe the solution you'd like  The proposed [Metrics API](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/486) is intended to help users of MDS - both cities, mobility service providers, and third-party ecosystem services - to have a standard way to consistently describe available metrics, and create an extensible interface for querying core MDS metrics and future metrics still to be defined.⁄ †It†should†be†a†framework†to†describe†how†different†API†users†and†hosts†can∫†††1Æ†Define†and†communicate†available†metricsª†2Æ†Request†these†metrics†across†multiple†dimensions†and†filtersª†3Æ†Serve†these†metrics†either†to†external†parties†or†to†other†MDS†API†consumers¨†without†requiring†the†transmission†of†the†underlying†raw†dataª†4Æ†Ensure†that†multiple†parties†can†reliably†reproduce†the†same†metrics¨†given†the†same†data††The†goal†is†to†be†able†to†define†‚_úMetric†X‚_ù†and†then†ensure†that†when†‚_úX‚_ù†is†calculated†by†the†city¨†authorized†parties¨†or†transportation†providers¨†the†result†will†be†identicalÆ†For†example¨†while†`n`†different†methods†may†exist†to calculate the utilization of a vehicle or a fleet for a given time range, the Metrics API is intended to ensure that for given method `k`, the same result will be produced regardless of who conducts the calculation, and there is a standard interface for authorized users to receive this data without requiring access to underlying raw data.  The Metrics API is intended to be useful for future MDS use cases, best practices and requirements.⁄ †Particularly notable is that it provides the foundation to implement data anonymization best practices, such as k-anonymityÆ⁄ †It also represents an important component needed to enable new MDS policy types and compliance evaluation as well as operations management use cases that can only be achieved by linking MDS metrics and MDS policy.

That can lead to private transactions containing the same privacy group id and version being distributed to a different set of members. This can lead to inconsistency in the privacy group state of the members. ,,
https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/besu/issues/762,604328717,Add support for private log subscriptions (Pub-Sub API),"### Description At the moment, the only options for retrieving logs generated by private contracts are using prig_getLogs or private filters.  It would be nice to also offer support for subscribing to private events.  This subscription would be similar to eth_subscribe (we should name it priv_susbscribe).  ### Acceptance Criteria * User can use priv_subscribe and priv_unsuibscribe to create subscriptions to private logs. * This should only support logs subscription. * The request to create a private logs subscription should be similar to creating a ""public"" log subscription. The only difference is that the privacyGroupId will be added as parameter index 0.  Definition: ``` # Subscribe request {   ""id"": 1,   ""method"": ""priv_subscribe"",   ""params"": [     ""<privacy_group_id>"",     ""logs"",     <filter_parameter_object>   ] }  # Unsubscribe request {   ""id"": 1,   ""method"": ""priv_unsubscribe"",   ""params"": [     ""<privacy_group_id>"",     ""<subscription_id>""   ] }  # Subscription notification {   ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",   ""method"": ""priv_subscription"",   ""params"": {     ""subscription"": ""<subscription_id>"",     ""privacyGroupId"": ""<privacy_group_id>"",     ""result"": <log_entry_object>   } } ```  Example: ``` # Subscribe request {   ""id"": 1,   ""method"": ""priv_subscribe"",   ""params"": [      ""OGD/1dkDZWb9VqgDfElovjYMDAcSiRUiB6fLtFRmugU="",     ""logs"",     {       ""address"": ""0x8320fe7702b96808f7bbc0d4a888ed1468216cfd"",       ""topics"": [         ""0xd78a0cb8bb633d06981248b816e7bd33c2a35a6089241d099fa519e361cab902""       ]     }   ] }  # Unsubscribe request {   ""id"": 1,   ""method"": ""priv_unsubscribe"",   ""params"": [     ""OGD/1dkDZWb9VqgDfElovjYMDAcSiRUiB6fLtFRmugU="",     ""0xcd0c3e8af590364c09d0fa6a1210faf5""   ] }  # Subscription notification {   ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",   ""method"": ""priv_subscription"",   ""params"": {     ""subscription"": ""0x1"",     ""privacyGroupId"": ""awEvxROVE0ydIgZyVFOfjvZKxaUwtOcWha/CJFHJ4Lw="",     ""result"": {       ""logIndex"": ""0x0"",       ""removed"": false,       ""blockNumber"": ""0x2de"",       ""blockHash"": ""0xe4657882a821af048bafbe64a6a0d40e61229c2ad1ef70bc9627e3adf0c941f7"",       ""transactionHash"": ""0xd3e7c320a3d3a8a28fa722611b12c52452dc1ed9e6b0400f7421628f1360b064"",       ""transactionIndex"": ""0x0"",       ""address"": ""0xd9104a5e123c0a026e35eaf7b500bd026921dbde"",       ""data"": ""0x"",       ""topics"": [         ""0x85bea11d86cefb165374e0f727bacf21dc2f4ea816493981ecf72dcfb212a410"",         ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002""       ]     }   } } ```",,

https://api.github.com/repos/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/480,600656186,Policy-Driven Trip Events,"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.  Cities want to be able to perform Policy compliance monitoring (both real-time and historical) for vehicles in motion. Currently, it is not possible to meet this need without requiring precise trip location data.  ### Describe the solution you'd like  The idea is that vehicles would emit events whenever they enter or leave a geography defined in the Policy endpoint. Then, instead of sharing the exact vehicle location, these events would simply give the UUID for the geography. This would be accomplished via the following changes:  **Rename events for entering and leaving municipal areas so they apply to all Policy geographies.**  - `enter_municipal_area` ‚_’ `enter_geography` - `leave_municipal_area` ‚_’ `leave_geography`  **Add the geography information to the event.**  - Add a new `event_geography` field containing the geography UUID to `Provider`. This field is required if `event_location` is not present. - Add a new `event_geography` field containing the geography UUID to `Agency`. This field is required if `telemetry` is not present.  **Remove requirement for precise location data for vehicles during trips.**  - Make `event_location` in Provider optional in the case of `vehicle_state:in_use` events - Make `telemetry` in agency optional in the case of `vehicle_state:in_use` events  ### Is this a breaking change  * Yes, breaking  ### Impacted Spec  For which spec is this feature being requested?   * `agency`  * `provider`  ### Describe alternatives you've considered  None at this time.  ### Additional context  Note that this proposal assumes/builds on the already proposed changes that unify and simplify Policy and Agency events:  https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/271  This issue is also related to a proposal to unify the way municipal boundaries and Policy geometries are expressed: https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/474 ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/besu/issues/614,590575491,Better handling of private and public nonces with Private Transactions,"This problem was first identified on #571. Given that the private transaction has its own nonce (relative to the sender account withing the privacy group), and the PMT has its own nonce (relative to the account that is creating the PMT), things can get messy.  The simplest scenario is the following: - account X has private nonce 0 in privacy group P - account X has public nonce 0 in the public world - User send privTx1 (sender: X, nonce: 0) and privTx2 (sender: X, nonce: 1)  When creating the PMT, we check for pending txs in the pool. However, things happen asynchronously so when creating the second PMT, the first one might not be in the pool yet. So we might end up with: -  PMT1(privTx1, sender: x, nonce: 0) - PMT2(privTx2, sender: X, nonce: 0)  This will lead to a failure of the second PMT.  Even worse, depending on the order that the transactions reach the client, we might end up with: - PMT1(privTx1, sender: x, nonce: 1) - PMT2(privTx2, sender: X, nonce: 0)  This will cause the PMTs to succeed but the underlying private transaction will be executed in the wrong order and will fail.  We have identified a workaround, using priv_distributeRawTransaction and eth_sendRawTransaction, to have control over the private and public nonces being used. However, this is hard work and it would be good if we could come up with an alternative.  This is the example of using web3js-eea to do it: https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea/blob/master/example/concurrentPrivateTransactions/concurrentPrivateTransactions.js",,

Sadly, there's no option to make it works without dumping first (and third party) cookies.  With a ""non cookie based session / client identifier"" option, it would be possible to only display an opt-out banner to the user instead of having to show them a Cookie Policy wall with ""Accept"" and ""Reject"" options.  When using your SDK on Single Page Applications, having a session ID generated in memory is fine and do the job most of the time.  Having the application generate the client ID for the SDK (usually based on the application own user's unique identifier) and pass it during the init process or via a dedicated method would also works nicely for all application where a user has to log-in in some way.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/rotki/rotki/issues/817,590120152,Implement more privacy-centric querying strategies,"## Abstract  As discussed in this thead https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1244536532901474304  If a user is not running their own node, the existing method of querying account balances can leak data about a user's portfolio to the API services (such as Infura or Etherscan). There are two strategies identified that could provide better privacy from snooping API services by making it difficult to link accounts together based on IP.  ## Motivation  Presently all queries are made to the same external API to check balances. This API could be malicious and attempt to piece together a user's portfolio based on the source IP of the query.  If a user queries the balance one publicly available address (such as a donation address or a `x.eth` domain) along with a bunch of other private addresses, it would be possible for the API service to assume that these balances are owned by the same user (especially if the API key and request types are known to be used by Rotki and are originating from the same IP), linking their identities to their portfolio including private addresses.  ## Specification  Two strategies can be implemented to mitigate this risk:  - Silo addresses to multiple different services, so that each service is only queried for a portion of the portfolio (i.e. 0x1 queries infura, 0x2 queries MEW, etc.), this prevents a single service from discovering the whole portfolio. - Create decoy queries to other address balances to obfuscate which addresses are truly owned by the user. The API services would not be able to tell which addresses are actually owned by the user, so determining their true portfolio would be impossible. These decoys should remain consistent between sessions to prevent leaking the real owned address over time.  Combined, these two approaches would make it very difficult for API services to which addresses are truly owned by the user, even if they colluded.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/besu/issues/550,585813382,Segment private state storage,"Right now the private state storage stores  1. $privateTxHash_LOGS -> the logs emitted from a contract call 2. $privateTxHash_OUTPUT -> the return value of a contract call 3. $blockhash_$pmtHash_METADATA -> the resulting state root for each transaction in each privacy group  The goal is to use the comlumnar rocksdb approach to segment the private state storage such that each type of value is in its own column.  The benefit of doing this is that it will be a cleaner approach wrt maintainability and it will be more performant.  An alternative approach to consider is to squash the data in an object and have only 1 key for the private state storage. It is possible to derive the private tx hash from the combination of block hash and PMT hash. The resulting key value pair would look like this:  $blockhash_$pmtHash -> {the resulting state root for each transaction in each privacy group, the logs emitted from a contract call, the return value of a contract call}",,

Validate the privateFrom in Orion -> drawback of adding logic to Orion  2. Have Orion pass the public key, that was used to decrypt the private Tx, back with the private transaction so Besu can validate the privateFrom 3. Option we haven't thought of yet   We're going with Option 2.   This change was made in https://github.com/PegaSysEng/orion/pull/317 and then reverted in https://github.com/PegaSysEng/orion/pull/318 because older versions of Besu did not allow the additional value.   So before re-instating we need to resolve how we're going to handle versioning - do we allow users to update Orion only?  Can we expect users of Besu to use a certain version of Orion?",,

This condition can probably happen on the side of the receiver but these are the steps I have found the most easy to reproduce the issue. For example, it also happened with only a single camera call from one party (same procedure as above, but just with one click on the camera button), so it's not necessarily because of multiple camera calls, but it's easier with the latter to produce the race condition.  More technically, I think the race condition happens when the call event sender closes the request, and this close event request arrives after the receiver accepted. So you have the whole timespan from the moment the receiver receives the call request, to the moment where either the caller receives the receiver event acceptation (failure to produce this bug, successful call) or the receiver receives the event that the caller closed the call (if there is such an event? Because this should close the call, and it does not). In any case, it should NOT be the receiver to close the call, it should be closed from the caller side (or any side that closes down the request anyway). That's why sending multiple call events increases the time window, because the receiver can then accept as soon as the first event arrives, but the caller is working on the nth call event and can reproduce the race condition by closing before this nth call event reaches the receiver.

Every other modern GDPR-compliant plugin for any type of information submission, be it an email list subsription, a comment form, or any other submission form, seem to understand this point and put a required tick box for consenting to data processing before submitting any forms.  Will you PLEASE consider adding this simple option so that Jetpack comments stay with the game. I desperately want to use Jetpack comments because of the added functionality of social logins. I have spent two days trying to find a solution and I can't (without learning to code and writing something bespoke).  GDPR Consent is not to be trifled with, and no self-respecting website owner would wish to be in breach of it. Please make it so that we can use Jetpack comments without breaking the law in the EU.  Please consider adding this, or alternatively if you can suggest a plugin which solves the issue I would love to hear about it. I found GDPR Comments plugin which put the necessary GDPR consent checkbox into the default Wordpress comments form, but sadly doesn't work for Jetpack Comments. What a shame.

https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/11030,501535645,Consider removing/replacing the sticker picker when the user changes their integration manager,"Unless you're a user who is intimately aware of how widgets and integration managers interact, you're going to assume that the sticker picker and integration manager are related. In fact, the integration manager adds the widget to your account but after that it's entirely possible to use a different integration manager from your sticker picker.   Most people expect that when you change your integration manager it also changes your sticker picker (the few that don't know about devtools and can fix it themselves). We should just reinforce that idea rather than keep punishing the user for not knowing better.  Removing the sticker picker when the integration manager is changed is easiest, and probably fine enough for most people. The user would fall into an awkward flow to re-add their sticker picker, but at least it'd be with the right manager. This also avoids the lack of ""make me a widget"" API that replacing would need.  Replacing the sticker picker would be the best bet, though Riot has no way of knowing what the integration manager wants its widget to look like. In future there will be a MSC to expose a ""make me a widget of X type"" API on integration managers for cases exactly like this. Common cases are Jitsi widgets (the URL structure is largely unknown to the client) and sticker pickers (if we go the replace route).  Instead of automatically doing all this, we could also add a toggle for ""also replace/remove my sticker picker"" below the change manager form. This is only useful if we expect people to want to keep their existing manager (they probably don't).",,

https://api.github.com/repos/friendica/friendica/issues/7691,501199602,ActivityPub: using sharedInbox for private deliveries can leak privacy,"### Expected behavior  Posts to lists/circles/aspects with one member should only be delivered to that one member.  ### Actual behavior  Privacy leakage through sharedInbox interface, delivering to all followers of the post creator on the remote site.  ### Steps to reproduce the problem  Send a post to a list/circle/aspect/whatever with one member but where you have other followers on that site. The private post is delivered to other followers. This *may* be platform specific, in this case Zap was used. See the following discussion.  This is a subtle artifact of sharedInbox behaviour. The default behaviour is ""if the public inbox is addressed, deliver to the public inbox, else deliver to all this actor's followers"". These are the only two use cases for this endpoint.   Note that the specific contents of the addressing fields is not directly referenced in this description; except to to detect the presence of the public inbox and use the addressing fields and attempt individual deliveries in the total absence of a sharedInbox.     Friendica is apparently delivering private posts addressed to lists/circles/aspects to the sharedInbox and not to the private inbox of the desired recipient(s). The recipient sharedInbox (in this case on a Zap system) is using the default sharedInbox behaviour and is therefore delivering to people outside the scope of the private post. Checking the actual addressing fields on Zap is not a workable solution because deliveries can be made to Bcc recipients who have been stripped from the server-to-server addressing fields per the spec. In the server to server case the inbound server is relatively dumb and needn't check addressing, only permission to post. The destination is determined by the endpoint used and recipients are checked only in the case of addressing the public inbox directly from the sharedInbox endpoint.  Some projects do check individual addresses, but haven't yet dealt with the Bcc bugs which they've introduced because Mastodon does not really use Bcc.  An amusing anecdote: it is apparently not possible to deliver to the public inbox via Bcc. This is an undocumented flaw in the spec caused by the inclusion of the ""deliver to my followers"" mode by Mastodon during the spec evolution. Probably not a serious flaw but mentioning here because I doubt anybody but myself is even aware of it.     I believe the only workable solution is to deliver private posts only to the private inboxes of the recipients. I am willing to listen to disagreement and other possibilities but point out this is likely to involve how to handle the Bcc case specially, and the recipient system doesn't really have any knowledge of the Bcc recipients unless this is a C2S transaction (which this is not).   ### Friendica version you encountered the problem see `example.com/friendica` on your Friendica node for the version information.  2019.09 running on libranet.de  ### Friendica source (git, zip)  unknown  ### PHP version  unknown  ### SQL version  unknown ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-web/issues/10636,484557194,The UX is a little confusing if you haven't accepted the terms of the default identity server.,"Right now there's bug that means you don't see the option to change your identity server before accepting the default identity server's terms. For the purposes of this issue, I'm assuming that issue is fixed.  I think the experience is confusing if you haven't accepted the terms of the default IS, in a way that is problematically insensitive to exactly the audience most interested in the privacy developments.  If you haven't accepted the terms of the default IS (this will be most users after the privacy changes go live), the verb to choose _not_ to use an identity server will be 'disconnect'. Disconnect unfortunately implies _connection_. Which makes it very unclear where data has been shared.  I think the UX issues can be solved by a slight change to the button text and perhaps microcopy. We could vary the button text/microcopy on the state of terms acceptance, or alternatively just find button text/microcopy that work noncontroversially in both cases.  To illustrate: on the left is what it will look like without further changes; on the right is a suggestion of possible copy change.  <img width=""1247"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1922197/63599139-dfbef980-c5b8-11e9-87d0-8dc498a1aaae.png""> ",,

This is subpar imo for a number of reasons:  1. There's a number of homeservers out there (including mine) which have not bothered to set up VoIP because there's no need for it. For instance, I don't make calls through Matrix and therefore haven't bothered to set it up. Getting a prompt is just going to be annoying for me. 2. Some homeservers (including some I run) intentionally have not set up a TURN server largely because of point 1. The users on the homeserver are largely not technologically inclined and do not make calls in the first place - this prompt will be confusing and annoying to them, regardless of the copy used. 3. It is yet another thing added the onboarding experience. The mobile apps are the worst offenders for this (https://github.com/vector-im/riot-meta/issues/214) and would now have 3 prompts at startup. New users trying to register for the app already feel drained by the time they actually get to send a message - another prompt that won't affect them is likely to be the nail in the coffin.",,

Github is becoming more problematic for Tor users to post bug reports.  To improve the credibility of the project and attract privacy-respecting developers, it's a good idea to move away from Github.  ## Privacy problems with Microsoft Github  1. MS feeds other privacy abusers:    1. (2012) MS spent $35 million on Facebook advertisements, making it the third highest financial supporter of a notorious privacy abuser that year.    1. Github uses Amazon AWS which triggers several privacy and ethical problems:       1. Amazon [paid $195k](http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1401518&view=late1&session=2017) to [fight privacy in CA](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/facebook-donated-200000-to-kill-a-privacy-law-but-now-its-backtracking/).       1. Amazon supported CISA.       1. Amazon is making an astronomical investment in facial recognition.       1. Amazon uses FedEx (an NRA-supporting ALEC member who feeds republican warchests via ALEC and NRA [republican policy is detrimental to individual privacy]).       1. Amazon distributes NRAtv which promotes a privacy-hostile political party and the resulting policies.  Also sells the Trump line of suits in their webshop.       1. Amazon spent $30 million and ranked in the top 5 promoters of Facebook ads in 2012 (thus substantially feeding a privacy abuser).       1. Amazon supplies AWS to Palantir, a database firm that exploits social media to [facilitate](https://www.govtech.com/biz/Documents-Reveal-ICE-Used-Palantir-for-Deportations.html) ICE and CBP to enforce Trump's inhumane *zero tolerance* immigration policy that entails child-parent separation.  Palantir was also co-founded by a notorious scumbag (Peter Thiel).       1. Amazon [supplies](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon-employees-demand-company-cut-ties-with-ice/) facial recognition to law enforcement who use it to abuse civil liberties.       1. Amazon drug tests its employees, thus intruding on their privacy outside the workplace and also harming their healthcare.       1. Amazon runs an extreme sweatshop that greatly diminishes quality of life.  The consequential mental health crisis is [evidenced](https://gizmodo.com/report-amazon-warehouses-called-911-for-mental-health-1833220938) by 189 calls from Amazon warehouses to 911 in five years. 1. Github is Tor-hostile [according to Tor project](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor#ComputingTechnical) -- and in my case, GH often forces me through an extra email verification step:  ![github-tor_hostility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21023035/61580062-10fd6300-aafd-11e9-8bf2-64faddf63760.png) 1. MS is a PRISM corporation prone to mass surveillance 1. MS lobbies for privacy-hostile policy:    1. MS supported CISPA and CISA unwarranted information exchange bills, and CISA passed.    1. (2018) MS [paid](http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1401518&view=late1&session=2017) $195k to [fight privacy in CA](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/facebook-donated-200000-to-kill-a-privacy-law-but-now-its-backtracking/) 1. MS supplies Bing search service which gives high rankings to [privacy-abusing](https://github.com/privacytoolsIO/privacytools.io/issues/374#issuecomment-460077544) CloudFlare websites. 1. MS supplies hotmail.com email service, which uses vigilante extremist org *Spamhaus* to force residential internet users to share all their e-mail metadata and payloads with a corporate third-party. 1. MS drug tests its employees, thus intruding on their privacy outside the workplace. 1. MS products (Office in particular) violate the GDPR  ## Alternatives  1. self-hosting (Gogs, Gitea, Gitlab, etc.)    1.

However, we'll want to write some code that implements this policy automatically, because it would be a pain to continually apply this policy manually to new sources.  I propose the following:  1. Add an `extended_privacy_allowed` boolean flag to the Source model that is True if the source has been granted a privacy exception, and False otherwise. This flag should only be settable by CoralNet admins via the admin web interface.  2. Implement a periodic task (running, say, every 24 hours) which iterates over all sources. If a source is private, over 1 year old (meaning the current date is over 1 year past the source creation date), and has the flag set to False, it gets converted to public.  3. On the Edit Source form, the 'Public' option should not be available if the source is over 1 year old and the flag is set to False.  4. On the Edit Source form, if the flag is set to True, there should be some text indicating that an exception has been granted (next to the Public/Private option).

Since the settings directory is hard-coded, one must have a separate settings directory for each account and then have a script that links `$HOME/.config/electron-mail` to the relevant directory before each login of one account, also taking care that only one instance runs at a time.  The fix is to offer a setting whereby all tabs are logged-out when EM is launched, and that they only login when the tab is clicked.  ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/clifordsymack/Electron-Cash/issues/105,421757460,Avoid re-use of change address if unused in a shuffle,"After #68 , there will always be one shuffler in a round that has no change address. The guy will nevertheless ""leak"" the change address to other shufflers - ordinarily this is not a big deal since change is trivially linked to input anyway. But if it's not used, the shuffler then goes on to re-use the address in another shuffle. This undesirably results in leaking linkage to other shufflers in the current pool unnecessarily, about an unrelated future shuffle whether for shuffle output or change output.  Potential solutions:  1) Do nothing. Might not be a big deal, but curious for inputs from other people. Information leak is limited - you'll have to isolate victim into reliably being the minimum party. But information leak is information leak, and can be harmful on a large scale surveillance basis...  2) Freeze an address if unused. Might be draconian, and can result in gap limit complications if too many are skipped, but straightforward to implement. Alternatively some scheme like reserving certain addresses for change (odd numbers?) might also work, but each has downsides.   3) Exchange change addresses later, and don't supply a change address if found yourself to be minimum (peers should ignore checking for change address from the minimum peer). Probably the most robust, but may involve more change in code, which can be undesirable.   What do you guys think?",,

https://api.github.com/repos/clifordsymack/Electron-Cash/issues/97,421007433,Subtle corner case where same shuffle output address might get re-used,"While reading the code today, I discovered a possible way that a shuffle output address could get re-used in the pathological circumstances described in #70 (Last player advantage).  Basically the other clients give up on the shuffle and go back to their queue and if things line up in an improbable but still possible way -- another shuffle can get set up to use the output address of the ""failed"" shuffle described in #70.  That shuffle eventually broadcasts by the lagged player and thus 2 outputs (1 possibly being an unshuffled 'change', the other shuffled non-change) can end up on the same address, after all is said and done.  This is unlikely but there needs to be a workaround and/or fix for this.  I have already thought of a strategy to address this -- imposing a ""cooling down"" period before re-using addresses of previously-failed shuffles just in case they eventually succeed and are broadcast by the lagged player.  This requires a little additional logic to be added but it's not too bad. I consider it a high priority as this corner case, while unlikely, may pop up occasionally and reduce confidence in the quality of this software if people get wind of it. ",,

I think this proposal will provide a good UX for whales as well as all other types of users.  ## Toggle-able tiers  - The shuffle client provides toggle-able tiers with a sane default, and most users never need to touch it. - Whales can expand their envelope up by enabling higher tiers - Users unwilling to mix coins bigger than `x` can disable all tiers over their limit. `x` could vary wildly depending on wealth and risk tolerance. - users that don't want to grind below `y` can disable the low tiers - etc.  ## Immediate benefit:  It should resolve all the specific concerns I have heard so far:  - want higher tiers - don't want lower tiers - shuffling must be uncomplicated and unsurprising for the user who never touches settings  ## Future shuffle-up benefit:  when shuffle-up is implemented, the profile becomes even more useful. It becomes a declaration of what kind of coins you want and the client can shuffle up/down to meet that.  ## Future preset profiles benefit:  This is questionable but possible in the future if all of the above works well. Some apps use preset profiles that cover a specific target group. For example:  - default - miner (enable higher tiers, disable lower ones) - conservative (nothing over `x`) - Every Day I'm Shuffling (all tiers) - fiat-oriented (your tier window shifts depending on the market price) - custom - ... whatever makes sense based on actual usage",,

All the same logic outlined in #72 can be used, except for the address reuse part, where one cannot simply change a flag at address reuse incoming event. When an incoming tx is detected that reuses an existing address, the wallet should automatically combine both and send them to a fresh address in the appropriate path.   Additionally, loading a virgin wallet should result in a big warning sign; if the user approves, then the wallet should attempt to identify categories outlined in #72 ; if an output is in an inappropriate bucket, it can be moved in a 1-in-1-out transaction to its appropriate bucket. Note that this might result in leaking information via timing observations.

https://api.github.com/repos/mycelium-com/wallet-android/issues/483,372755873,Mixed mode for SegWit wallets,"In the migration to SegWit and bech32, one usability obstacle was, what to do in order to transition from legacy to segwit accounts and how to phase in bech32 when almost no wallets support it.  Create accounts per type (hardware wallets do this) -----  This approach would mean that the user would keep using his legacy accounts as defined by BIP44 and when creating a new account, it would default to BIP49 (segWit compatibility mode) and the user could also create accounts according to BIP84 (segwit bech32) or BIP44 (legacy).  **Advantages:**  * Compatibility with the existing standards (BIP44, 49 and 84). The change output goes into the same and only content type as the funds were in before and thus no change goes to unused accounts or even unused accounts creating gaps. * Hardware wallets don't show scary messages, as the change output is treated as a second ""send"", although the device might mark it as going to the device. Anyone but very tech savvy users will get scared when paying a $5 coffee with their trezor and get asked if they really want to send $5000 to ""1xyz... Trezor#1"". * No extra addresses to scan per account, as the look-ahead of all three types would be tracked per account as per the user's use of these.  Mix account types ----  Here, ""Account 1"" would actually encompass account 1 as defined by all relevant bips (44, 49 and 84). The user would be able to receive on either segwit (P2SH is compatible with all existing wallets) or bech32 into the ""same"" account. When sending funds to any address, change could get received into the sub-account of the according type.  **Advantages:**  * The user would not have to switch to a completely different account to make use of the new features and when the counter party doesn't support that type, switch back to a compatible account. * Chain analysis would have an harder time figuring out which is the change output as not the input dictates the change output type but the spend output.  Status -----  In our (still private) segwit branch we took the mixed mode approach, valuing ease of use and privacy higher than slightly higher resource consumption and potentially harder migration to other standard wallets, especially as other wallets seam to also have taken this approach. Our main obstacle is hardware wallets and we are evaluating if there was a way to both have the privacy benefits and the change output not scare the user.",,

Zero rush though would be curious on what the timeline is for enabling access to MDS data to academic and nonprofit research teams.   Lots of fascinating social science questions that could be addressed with this dataset. Also lots of urban planning benefits and applied R&D that could be done. I would also be curious to see if accelerometer data could be integrated into MDS as a measure of street quality.   As Boston's Street Bump experiment showed, accelerometer data is great for detecting potholes though has false defect positives with street hardware and false negatives with cracking. Note that a key benefit here with scooters is the ability to get a measure of ride quality on sidewalks and bike lanes -- the [maintenance of which is a multi-million issue and liability for cities. ](https://www.kcet.org/shows/socal-connected/cycle-of-disrepair)  There's also broader planning benefits from streamlining data sharing for research. Imagine for example the not too distant future where there's mobility service providers (not just shared e-scooters though also larger AVs) operating across the entire Southland. Important to have data to manage and start planning for that today.   Definitely needs to be sensitive to privacy considerations with trip level data (even if its just a device and not a user ID -- see the NYC taxi dataset for a cautionary tale) though those can definitely be addressed ethically and pragmatically.

Another option would be adding a random number to the coordinate but if a user took enough pictures from his house, averaging all the coordinates would give their location. This would allow the user to choose between different sensitivities of geotagging instead of removing the feature(#1644).   Additionally, a UI to edit EXIF data of a specific image from the ShareActivity could be implemented but I'm not sure how much of the upload workflow would have to be changed for that.  Also, what could be done about making location and timing information available for endangered species through the same feature?

https://api.github.com/repos/beijbom/coralnet/issues/148,328738381,Don't require Google Analytics,"You know how lots of websites these days have popups asking you whether you're okay with cookies? That's what this is about; Google Analytics is based on cookies.  Cookie-based analytics are a privacy concern, as explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics#Problems_with_cookies ""third-party cookies in principle allow tracking an individual user across the sites of different companies, allowing the analytics vendor to collate the user's activity on sites where he provided personal information with his activity on other sites where he thought he was anonymous.""  A few possible paths:  - Make Google Analytics opt-in   - Possibly show the choice prominently on their next visit   - Possibly set off automatically if Do Not Track is detected - Replace Google Analytics with a simpler analytics system that doesn't use cookies - Ditch analytics altogether  When do we need cookie-based analytics? It depends on whether we need to track/identify users between different requests. For example, tracking which pages a specific user goes to at what times, in order to piece together their workflow. Technically speaking, this does not have to be done through cookies; Annotation History has a basic form of time-based tracking, for example (records annotation tool accesses as well as annotation actions). But expanding that system to a more general form of tracking throughout the whole site would be time consuming. It would be easier to incorporate an existing analytics system, and using cookies is the most common and probably most framework-agnostic way to do that.  So the other question is: do we need this kind of time-based tracking in more places besides Annotation History? I'm inclined to say we don't need it. We're more concerned about delivering a useful product rather than trying to maximize clicks. We get a lot of good ideas for useful features just by asking our users.  There are of course simpler uses of analytics such as keeping count of visits from each web browser or operating system, and that almost certainly doesn't need cookies. We might consider having more lightweight analytics which just focus on these kinds of stats.",,

Actually deleting the User object could be problematic, if the user is still tied to existing annotations, uploaded images, etc. So we don't delete the User object, but we do the next best thing, which is erasing every trace of that's user personal info.

For example, on WordCamp.org, we want to retain our contact form submissions for 3 years, so any Feedback posts that are newer than that shouldn't be erased.  To this end, I'm proposing the following changes, which I will add as commits to this PR:  * Use associative strings when registering the exporter and eraser callbacks * Allow individual items to be skipped during erasure via a filter, similar to how Core's comments eraser works * ~Perhaps add filters to modify which individual Feedback fields get exported and erased~  #### Testing instructions:  Follow the testing steps in #9395 to get set up and confirm that data export/erasure are working. Then:  * Copy [this file](https://gist.github.com/coreymckrill/bed546ef05c9917d0d01618588a2c206) into the **wp-content/mu-plugins** folder. * Perform the two tests separately, uncommenting the relevant lines to activate them. * For Test 1, the result should be that the data export does _not_ include feedback posts, and during data erasure, the feedback posts are _not_ deleted. * For Test 2, during erasure, you should see a message that personal data was found, but not erased, followed by the ""because reasons"" message.  #### Proposed changelog entry for your changes:  * Privacy tools: Identify the data export/erasure callbacks for Feedback posts using associative keys, to better match the convention in Core. * Privacy tools: Added the `grunion_contact_form_delete_feedback_post` filter hook to allow specific Feedback posts to be bypassed during data erasure requests, similar to the `wp_anonymize_comment` filter in Core.

For example, if you've configured multiple sidebars and only one of those sidebars is ever actually displayed; i.e., there are plugins to show sidebars conditionally.

The first is the normal register for the manage integrations button check, however the second appears to be coming from the AppTile getting set up. Although it's not really a huge issue, it's causing uneeded duplicate data in the integration manager and homeserver (by requesting 2 sets of open ID tokens).  ### Version information  <!-- IMPORTANT: please answer the following questions, to help us narrow down the problem -->  - **Platform**: web (in-browser) - **Browser**: Chrome 63 - **OS**: Windows 10 - **URL**: riot.im/develop",,

Text between <!-- and --‚__> marks will be invisible in the report. -->  ### Description  **Full disclosure**: I'm obviously biased for wanting this due to my work on Dimension. Please keep that in mind while considering this proposal.  If individuals want to change their integrations manager then they must deploy their own instance of Riot, or compile it themselves if they are electron users. Instead, power users should be able to set the rest api url and ui url in a synced setting. This does have the downside of people having to enter 2 more urls (see: login page), but ideally it would be put under the ""advanced"" section to avoid people accidentally changing them. The user should also have the option to disable the integrations manager entirely, or reset the settings to the default (inherit from config.json).   A question would be should the config.json expose flags for overriding the user's preference? This would probably only be useful in corporate environments where security is a concern (force disable or force use corporate deployment).  I'm open to writing the PR for this, but would like feedback from the team/community on the approach. The 2 fields is an option, but it isn't as smooth as it could be. Ideally users would be able to select from a dropdown which manager they'd like to use, but this leaves the question of how do new integration managers get on that list (or in the case of Dimension, self-deployed instances). It could be hardcoded into the source, or provided through a config.json list, but that leaves the question of ""should manager X be used on client Y when Y doesn't explicitly list support for manager X?"" (I would think yes, and Riot should show the selected manager in the dropdown anyways, even if it isn't supported on the current client).

https://api.github.com/repos/mycelium-com/wallet-android/issues/374,248202988,Bijective send proposal,"Respectfully submitted for future consideration and possible implementation as and when resources permit. Incorporated here by reference and also copied-and-pasted below.   https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/2175  ----  I'm going to present a far-out idea that I hope one day will be commonly implemented.  Suppose we have a deterministic wallet A based on a master private key⁄ A, and we want to transfer all funds from this wallet into another deterministic wallet⁄ B based on a master private key⁄ B.  Possible reasons why we might want to do this: - We suspect that private key⁄ A has been compromised. - We want to†""close out"" our books on wallet⁄ A, so to speak, and begin this year with a fresh, empty transaction history in wallet⁄ B. - We're simply making a large payment.  The normal†""sweep"" procedure is to just do a single send of all the funds. So all the unspent funds in all of the addresses in wallet⁄ A end up in a single place in wallet⁄ B. The big problem here is loss of privacy: In wallet⁄ A we generated a new address each time we received funds, and now all of those addresses show up as sending into a single destination address.  Proposed solution: A bijective send. When given this command, and given two sets of addresses, our software sends the funds available in each address in wallet⁄ A to a separate address in wallet⁄ B.  Optionally, this could be a batched command, executing over hours or days, so the blockchain would not show the sends as occurring together in time.  Optionally, a threshold could be specified, and funds less than that in an address would be ignored, to avoid creating unnecessary dust where the transaction fee would swallow most of the available funds.  Implementation would require the sending wallet to have a list of receiving addresses. If both wallets are held within the same software, then that is easy. If not, then the sending wallet would need to either be able to generate receiving addresses from a master public key, or be simply provided with a list.  A bijective send could be used when paying another party. Our wallet would pick N addresses from which to send, send the value N to the receiving party, and get a list of N receiving addresses. The bijective send would then send the desired funds, with any excess going to a single change address. Privacy is preserved, because multiple addresses do not lead to one receiving address.",,

This could be done at the server itself, but then the server would be able to sniff it and it wouldn't work with E2E uploads which are probably the most important ones anyway.

https://api.github.com/repos/AdamISZ/CoinSwapCS/issues/18,224754096,Timing correlation and slow mode,"For attempting to mix in with the larger anonymity set, it is obviously unhelpful that in the simplest form, a coinswap will consist of 2 pairs of transactions of (a) the same size and (b) being broadcast at approximately the same time.  It's worth observing that even though this correlation is obviously a big deal, it's only so for the more sophisticated snoopers; any snooping currently based on history and not taking a global blockchain view would be broken; and also in case of very high volumes the correlations get harder rapidly, depending on (a).  W.r.t (a), amount correlation is deferred to another issue, w.r.t. (b):  Default behaviour should probably be to stagger the broadcasts in a somewhat random way. The protocol needn't be changed much: TX0 can broadcast as normal, TX1 can wait for a preset random delay (best to be agreed in advance in private in the `CoinSwapPublicParameters`), and Alice's `see_tx0_tx1` can be recoded to accommodate this. The same can go for a delay between Alice's TX5 broadcast and Carol's TX4 broadcast; for this one, Alice can fortunately ignore the delay since she already has the funds; this reduces Alice's slowdown to one of the two delays.  This may well interact with #8 in the following sense: a slow mode will lock up Carol's liquidity for a longer time, so it may require higher fees.  I'd envision this being a `fast` option on command line, defaulting to False, with a warning about privacy in case it's disabled. More tricky is to think about what kind of random distribution is appropriate.  I've specifically marked this milestone 0.1 as I think a decent mainnet implementation really must have this at least to make timing correlation problematic, if not impossible for an attacker.",,

The TX4/TX5 spends out to a single address; either sourced from the relevant mixdepth in the joinmarket wallet, or a destination if specified.  It would be better to have two outputs, with one being a ""dummy change"". This should be optional but should almost certainly be the default.",,
https://api.github.com/repos/AdamISZ/CoinSwapCS/issues/12,224441023,2 of 3 and 2 of 2 anonymity set,"In cooperative case we have paths (wallet)-> p2sh 2 of 2 -> (other wallet). This ""hides"" in the anonymity set of all 2 of 2 addresses (with huge caveat of timing and amount correlation, set that aside for now).  However, the anonymity set of *all* multisig p2sh, in particular 2 of 3 + 2 of 2, is much bigger, and there is no reason to use it, since the third key can just be a dummy NUMS key (thus ensuring that neither party can get hold of a majority themselves). 3 of 3 could also be included of course.  Rough plan:  * Gather data on statistical distribution of 2/2, 2/3, others. * Add configuration to use one or other or, default, follow stat. distn above. * Change the `CoinSwapTX01` template object to allow configuration of number of keys * Create routines to inject NUMS keys * Change `CoinSwapPublicParameters` to allow this * Pay careful attention to key ordering; make it lexicographical for maximum flexibility and hiding (i.e. I believe a lot of code uses lexicographical ordering already and it's simplest) * Change `CoinSwapTX01` signing code to handle it properly.  Note that I believe it's pointless to modify `CoinSwapTX23` code, since they by nature immediately expose the coinswap behaviour in the backout case. It *may* not hurt though, will review.

Information Minimization. There seems to be some philosophical conflict presented here. On the one hand, the CSP is encouraged to collect attributes that are ""the minimum necessary."" Yet, on the other hand, they are permitted to collect additional information provided the ""applicant explicitly consents to the CSP collecting and storing the attributes."" Shouldn't the information be collected as needed (i.e. when the applicant needs a higher IAL, they can then add more information to the CSP's repository). In fact, in reference to Table 4-2, the document requires that agencies ""SHALL NOT select an IAL that is higher than necessary for the business purpose of the digital service."" Why would CSPs be allowed to collect information in a similar way?⁄ Otherwise, the CSP may be storing more information than necessary on many users, increasing the impact of a breach or potentially allowing a compromised applicant to apply for a higher IAL with pre-supplied information.

Even in situations of manual registration, it adds an unnecessary extra step.  I propose we strike both sentences. ",,

Secondly, when used for identity proofing, the combination of Name, DOB and _Current_ Address are typically 90-some percent reliable in uniquely resolving an identity within commercial databases.  The addition of other attributes such as SSN, previous address, gender (gasp), and whether or not ""Name"" is defined as Full First, Last and  Middle or simply First Initial + Last Name, etc.  can improve accuracy to the very high 90s.  With many commercial databases the terms Name, DOB and Address are slightly ambiguous.  They need to be more precisely defined to be useful.  For example, is Middle initial allowable in ""Name""?  Does ""address"" include street, city, state and zip?     Suggested Change: 1.  Either:  Fully specify the definitions: of Name (First, Last, Middle, - initials, prefix, suffix), DOB (MMDDYY, MMYY, etc.), and Address (full, street, etc.) _AND/OR_  2.  Do not precisely define ""Claimed Identity"" as ""Name, DOB and Address"" rather, define it more generically as a ""claim of ownership of a set of identity attributes"".  The identity proofer, consistent with the requirements of the particular Identity Assurance Level, will verify the claimed attributes can be resolved to a unique identity with XX% accuracy.   ---  Organization: 1 = Federal, 2 = Industry, 3 = Other  ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/181,165020273,Remove from EXIF: geo info if too close to home,"A privacy protecting EXIF stripper was mentioned on #97. Most important is removing 1. real name from copyright field, if the camera adds it and the user wishes to remain pseudonomous, or 2. geo info if it geolocates the person fairly accurately.  An external app to perform this isnt very helpful, as most users will want to keep EXIF on the media on their device, but upload to Commons without some of the EXIF, and possibly only remove it for some media. The user doesnt want to create a separate set of images before uploading.  E.g. I am not pseudonomous, so name doesnt bother me. And the internet knows roughly where I live and that is ok. However if I upload lots of images, I will likely have a large cluster of uploads nearer where I live and deductions could easily be made. To avoid that, I would prefer less specific geo info, creating an empty area within my upload geo infomation.  Where I am living now, I would appreciate the geo being removed if it is within ~2kms of my home. However I have lived in places where there are only a few homes within 10km, so I would want geo removed for a wider region. Each person will have their own privacy considerations. ",,
https://api.github.com/repos/usnistgov/800-63-3/issues/108,163021538,SSN Collection for Resolution/Validation versus Verification ,"**Organization**: ID.me  **Type**: 2  **Document (63-3, 63A, 63B, or 63C)**: 63A  **Reference (Include section and paragraph number)**: Section 5, 5.2, 1  **Comment (Include rationale for comment)**: The requirement to not collect SSN is prescriptive and process oriented versus outcome and results based. The reality is that SSN is the only ubiquitous identifier for Americans and there are no viable alternatives to resolve a unique identity in a way that Relying Parties and Identity Providers could use to release sensitive PII and/or records related to a specific person. For example, if the identity provider uses a drivers license number instead of an SSN as a unique identifier for the individual, the Relying Party, let's say any federal agency, will be unable to use the drivers license number as they are highly unlikely to have a drivers license associated with unique identities and related records in their database. They have SSN as the unique identifier.   **Suggested Change**: At a high level, NIST should avoid prescriptive guidance and should instead focus on results based guidance, particularly if there are no viable alternatives at the moment as, a priori, we can expect that future interpretation of an ambiguous clause related to process will be decided by an auditor's subjective opinion and thus will vary according to the luck of the draw for the CSP. For this specific issue, the scope should be more narrowly construed. SSN should be fine and acceptable for attribute validation and for identity resolution. As a static identifier that has been compromised in numerous breaches (Anthem, OPM, etc), it should not be used for identity verification. This comment, if retained, should be moved to Section 5.4, Identity Verification, and should not inhibit or impact CSPs with respect to validation and resolution.   ---  Organization: 1 = Federal, 2 = Industry, 3 = Other  ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/CroceRossaCatania/gaia/issues/1721,52098836,Validazione Tesserini,"Voglio condividere un pensiero con voi, chiedere opinioni ed eventualmente agire di conseguenza.  ## Obiettivo - Ottenere uno strumento di Validazione Tesserini accessibile a tutti ed utile nei confronti della popolazione civile, al fine di aumentare la fiducia nell'Associazione e nei Volontari - con un potenziale ritorno d'immagine per affidabilita' considerevole. Esempi di utenti del servizio potrebbero essere:   - Civile responsabile per l'accettazione dei volontari in un ambiente con altri utenti vulnerabili, che vuole verificare l'effettiva identita' del Volontario e lo stato in servizio;   - Volontario CRI responsabile per l'accettazione di volontari di un altro comitato presso un'importante attivita', di emergenza o meno, che vuole verificare sia l'identita' che l'effettiva autorizzazione del Volontario a svolgere l'attivita'; ## Problematiche attuali - Attualmente, il sistema di validazione dei tesserini e' poco utile per la popolazione civile. Quando un tesserino viene validato tramite Gaia, le informazioni ritornate son solo una lettera casuale del nome del volontario. Questo ispira poca fiducia. Non e' inoltre disponibile un'applicazione mobile multipiattaforma per la scansione dei tesserini. ## Prerequisiti - Un sistema di sicurezza informatico adeguato, che impedisca la richiesta casuale di validazione di tesserini, per evitare che un numero di tesserino venga ""indovinato"" in seguito a vari tenatitivi. Le specifiche di tale sistema seguiranno se approvato. ## Applicazioni - Applicazione ""_Validazione Tesserini CRI_"" per le seguenti piattaforme: Android 2+, Windows Phone, iOS, Blackberry; - Pagina di validazione tesserini aperta al pubblico su Gaia. ## Proposta  Alla scansione del tesserino, i seguenti dati verranno ritornati all'utente che ne richiede la validazione: - Nome e cognome del volontario **oppure** prima lettera del nome e prima lettera del cognome; - Fotografia del tesserino da Gaia: Questo perche' il volontario potrebbe aver cambiato aspetto, quindi dispositivo mostra sempre l'ultima fotografia del tesserino caricata su Gaia - specialmente se questa e' cambiata dalla stampa del tesserino - garantisce un riconoscimento piu' facile; - Comitato attuale e stato (es. MEMBRO presso Comitato, SOSPESO presso Comitato, ecc.); - Eventuali deleghe (es. PRESIDENTE, UFFICIO SOCI, ...) anche temporanee e comitato di delega; - Nome delle attivita' a cui il volontario e' autorizzato a partecipare nell'arco delle 6 ore precedenti e 6 ore successive; ## Realizzazione - L'app mobile verra' realizzata con tecnologia Apache Cordova (Framework Ionic) utilizzando le API di Gaia, questo garantira' portabilita' ed user experice unica across tutte le piattaforme; - Il sistema di validazione tesserini online verra' migliorato - nota importante sara' il perfezionamento per il funzionamento con i lettori di codice a barre, come quelli di JUMP.  ---  Chiedo opionione a: @ico88, @PaoloGiustiniani, @galamarco, @biagiosaitta, @AngeloLupo, @alfiomusmarra e Principato per mezzo @ico88.

The settings for this feature will be placed in brave://settings/socialBlocking  An example of how redirection will happen for opt-in users. 1.) User visits a site which has a youtube link for a video. 2.) The user clicks on the link to watch the video on youtube. 3.)

Initial suggestion is 10, but any cap thats << the global cap would work - De-limit: remove, or greatly expand, the global cap, to increase the number of eTLD+1s an attack has to control to carry out the attack  Once this is done for websockets, we could look for other connection pools and global limits to apply similar mitigations to.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/16250,912096045,"The upcoming ""Clear data on exit"" feature is hardly compatible with the aggressive mode for ads & trackers blocking and the strict fingerprinting protection preference","Moving the discussion over here since https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/16214 was closed yesterday.   Disabling ""Clear data on exit"" by default is a step into the right direction, but unfortunately it's not enough as of the moment. I'll try to go into detail because the problem is deeper than people think at first.  Let's begin over here: https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/8790  The mentioned pull request introduces the global Shields settings functionality, along with an aggressive mode for ads & trackers blocking, a strict fingerprinting protection, and eventually an option to clear the browsing data on exit.  Here comes the issue, which makes the ""Clear data on exit"" option hardly compatible with the aggressive ads & trackers mode and the strict fingerprinting protection:  - https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/15347 - https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/16217  Since the ""Clear data on exit"" option includes the clearing of the browsing data for ""Site and Shields Settings"", and that can't be changed anyhow, the following will happen:  - A lot of users will enable the aggressive mode for ads & trackers blocking, along with a strict fingerprinting protection - Then a lot of users will enable the ""Clear data on exit"" option, because it's a highly anticipated option - Closing the browser will lead to the following: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/16217  In other words, if users want to use all 3 new features (aggressive blocking of ads & trackers, a strict fingerprinting protection, and want to clear their browsing data on exit), they'll have to re-adjust the global Shields settings every single time they open their browser, because clearing the browsing data for ""Site and Shields Settings"" will reset the global Shields settings every single time users close their browser.  My suggestions until https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/15347 is fixed:  - Allow users to choose which browsing data they want to clear on exit so they can disable the clearing of the browsing data for ""Site and Shields Settings"" - If the previous suggestion is a lot of work for the remaining time until the next major release, simply exclude the clearing of the browsing data for ""Site and Shields Settings"" from the ""Clear data on exit"" feature - If, for some reason, the option above is not possible either, introduce a warning dialog that informs users of the consequences of clearing the browsing data  If you proceed with the implementation of the ""Clear data on exit"" feature in its current state, you'll give users a false sense of stronger privacy protection. A lot of users won't notice that their global Shields settings have reset to their default values after they close their browser (clear their browsing data). ",,
https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/16215,909941898,Potential WebAudio farbling enhancements,"The current WebAudio farbling implementation involves perturbing the amplitude of an output signal by a scaling factor close to 1 that is pseudo-randomized over time. This introduces a small amount of noise to the WebAudio output. Practically speaking, that noise is quiet enough to be imperceptible.  **In the event that an even-less-perceptible solution is required**, it should be possible to achieve this by instead mixing in additional signals above and/or below the range of human hearing. The frequency of any additional signals would be gradually changed over time to prevent them from being cancelled out by trivial zero-crossing or FFT analysis. Although an adversary could remove these signals with corresponding high or low pass filtering, the integrity of the original signal would not be recoverable at a fidelity useful for fingerprinting.  The changes to the signal frequencies should be carried out on timescales unrelated to the system's frame length, which is not currently visible to JavaScript and could potentially introduce an additional fingerprinting vector. It should be sufficient to modify the frequencies an a fixed-length window.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/16133,905934405,Brave Adblocker filter list 'unbreak' should stop whitelisting 1p DuckDuckGo analytics in Aggressive mode (I guess happens with other sites as well),"Hi, We all know, Brave didn't block 1p in the beginning, but since that has changed with the introduction of Aggressive mode, I think Brave adblocker Unbreak.txt filter list (and maybe other lists) should stop whitelisting stuff, like that.  Earlier today, someone was saying how ""Brave adblocker doesn't block DDG ads"", the only thing that aggressive mode doesn't block compared to uBlock are some ddg images that have the _**improving.duckduckgo.com**_ URL on them. Of course, it doesn't matter if you add a custom filter to block it, nothing will happen because it is an exception on the unbreak internal Brave list https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-unbreak.txt which users can't do anything about unless you Brave Team do it.  But the commit about it it is like too old, dated back in September 2018 (https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/commit/d8e1edb02141ebb510e68827a4297d8ad539b9a2) when aggressive mode wasn't really implemented at all, and Brave was meant to block only 3p. But you even whitelisted it as ""DDG 1P analytics and optimization"", well, I don't think people who set stuff to aggressive want really have anything to do with DDG analytics.  Of course I mention DDG, but I will have to guess it happens with other sites as well and I think it would be a good idea to revisit Unbreak filter list and see what really unbreak sites and what was done to whitelist 1p, because you wanted to be nice about it, I mean, you are still nice since the default is Standard mode, and that's fine, but Aggressive should not have these whitelisted 1p stuff that doesn't break sites when blocked.  The closer Brave blocks to uBlock in aggressive mode the better, it will also stop users from assuming uBlock is just better just because they can see ads being blocked by uBlock while they don't see the same or any increase in the tracking or ads blocked at all in Brave adblocker like happens in DDG.

https://api.github.com/repos/gordon-cs/gordon-360-ui/issues/1135,897208621,Handle private students in involvement membership and requests,"Students who are private (have a value `'P'` in the `KeepPrivate` column of `CCT.dbo.Student`) are not visible to other students on 360. Private students won't appear in searches made by other students, and trying to navigate to a private students profile as a student returns a 404 Profile Not Found. Faculty and Staff are still able to see such students, but they are shown privacy disclaimers. When a FacStaff person views a private student's profile, the student's personal info is marked with a red disclaimer specifying that the student's info is private and not visible to other students.  However, when such a private student joins involvements, their visibility is increased in at least two ways, which may constitute a violation of their expected privacy: 1. We currently show private students who are members of an involvement to other members of that involvement, both students and FacStaff. This is inconsistent with private students being hidden from other students across the site otherwise. There is a question of whether involvements are a trusted and known group that students are okay being visible with (since only members of the group can see other members). However, this decision should be left up to the student, and we ought to default to not exposing them at all. The solution seems to therefore be two-fold:     1. ASAP, filter the list of group members so that students marked as private are not shown to other students. They can still be seen by super admins and FacStaff group members, but there should be a clear visual indicator (similar to the one on PublicProfile) that FacStaff are seeing privileged, private information that should not be shared.      2. Potentially allow students to make themselves visible to the group if they so choose.    1. When a private student requests to join an involvement, their membership request is visible to all group admins of the involvement they requested to join, including other students who are group admins. This is an issue because a student who asks to join an involvement currently has no way of knowing that they will be made visible, much less to whom. There are two obvious solutions, but there may be other, better ways:      1. One solution would be to only show membership requests from private students to Faculty/Staff. However, in some cases, the student leaders are the only ones actively administering an involvement. In such cases, this approach would risk hiding the private students request such that they are never able to join certain involvements.       2. Another solution is to allow student leaders to see requests from private students, and warn private students ahead of time that this is the case. For example, when a private student requests to join a membership, they would be shown a dialog informing them that submitting their request may show their name and email to the group leaders, including [list of student group admins]. They would have to confirm that they understand and are okay with that before their request is submitted. If they decide they aren't comfortable with that, they could email the group's FacStaff advisor or 360@gordon.edu and directly request to be added. This way, the student is informed and in control of their own privacy.",,

This would be a web compat improvement, not a privacy improvement - Change `getExtension` to return NULL for all values except `WEBGL_debug_renderer_info`    ## Original message  I've been testing WebGLRenderingContext.getSupportedExtensions() with farbling level _maximum_ and I get _null_ as return value, but I was expecting [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/getSupportedExtensions). I looked at some tests in Brave and they are checking for _null_, so I guess it's intentional, may be related to #3326  And then WebGLRenderingContext.getExtension() should return bottom value at maximum level (I am guessing _null_) according to #9188, but I get same results on farbling level _maximum_ and _disabled_. Wouldn't fingerprinting script just check for all possible extensions?    I am running Version 1.24.84 Chromium: 90.0.4430.93 (Official Build) (64-bit)",,

Upstream changes:  https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/6a5c4d21ede82be4ec7a78efc362577bfd24d4eb  <pre> HWR: Add a kHandwritingRecognitionWebPlatformApi feature to control OT & mojo.  The added flag controls whether the feature is enabled in browser and whether origin trials (OT) can enable the feature in renderer. Thus a well-behaved renderer will not show the JS API as existing when the flag is disabled, and a compromised renderer still won't be able to bind anything on the mojo interface if the flag is disabled. Note: there will be a separate CL to turn on the OT.  Replacement for crrev.com/c/2814164 </pre>  https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/8121a60c6abfe2dd812139cfcec0c6bcc1084905  <pre> HWR: Add another flag so finch can be used to control HWR API.  The existing kHandwritingRecognitionWebPlatformApi flag will be set by command-line on specific devices, which overrides any setting from finch. So we add another flag (default enabled) and require both flags enabled for the HWR API to be accessible (in either JS or Mojo). </pre> ",,

The current configuration uses the FledgeInterestGroups feature as both a global guard for the feature as well as a control for an origin trial. Ideally we want to be able to disable most of the code related to the feature. Since that cannot be done at runtime on a case by case basis we can't use a runtime flag for that.  This change uses the previous flag as a global on/off switch, while adding a separate feature flag to control a possible future origin trial. </pre>",,

To mitigate this risk, it should be possible to have separate settings between sessions.

In the case of the first one however, we expect a high click-through rate because of the implicit intent to visit the destination site (on the other side of the tracker).

You can also test it in https://www.twitch.tv/directory where you will see game cover images (JPG) get blocked 'correctly' and don't display the broken icon, the ones that do display the issue are Recommended Channel avatars on the sidebar which are png, and the ones in 'Games, IRL, Music and Esports' section are SVG and get the problem as well. ![Problem in Twitch Directory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44932435/112532379-5e1fe680-8d6e-11eb-90e7-4eecf3145b10.png)   Now if you go to a game like https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Retro now all images I think get the same problem, the channel thumbnails are jpg, and the channel avatars are png. So everything gets messed up in here regardless of the format.  ![Problem Retro category](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44932435/112532413-67a94e80-8d6e-11eb-9b96-f838b5acd088.png)   It's been like this for months and months so while not a big problem I hope this gets fixed eventually, while not critical it is still a bug and doesn't look good since it is not doing the job it should or it is supposed to do, it happens everywhere but I tried to find the extreme case to really show and test it.

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/14943,840571029,Clear ephemeral storage partitions after a small time period,"Currently all 3p partitioned storage under a 1p is cleared the moment there are no more tabs with the 1p as the top level document.  This mostly works great, but doesn't handle some oauth style flows.  For example: 1. example.org includes a 3p frame that handles SSO 2. interacting with the 3p frame redirects the top level frame to an origin controlled by the SSO provider 3. the top level frame then redirects back to example.org 4. the SSO provider (embedded under example.org) expects that its state will still be there when the top level frame loads example.org  Right now the above flow breaks, since the embedded SSO provider state is cleared the moment the top level document is navigated.  We should handle such cases by modifying when we clear the 3p storage areas.  Instead of clearing them the moment there are no more top level documents for the site doing the embedding, we should instead clear them after a brief pause (e.g., 30 seconds after there are no more top level documents for the site).   This will handle most cases of the above flow.  We can expand the time out further if needed (for example, if someone needs to type in credentials for the SSO provider, 30 sec may not be enough), but this issue suggests 30 seconds for an initial approach.  There are QA tests for this behavior (assuming a 30 second timer) here: https://dev-pages.brave.software/storage/keep-alive.html",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/14825,835242878,Collapse frames with blocked content,"uBlock Origin has some code that causes frames whose sources are blocked to be collapsed.  It appears that this works by generating a randomized alphanumeric string on each page load and adding it as an attribute to each blocked `iframe` element, and also injecting a CSS rule designed to block any element with that attribute.  e.g. when loading the following HTML: ```html <html>     <body>         <iframe src=""https://1-1ads.com/test.html""></iframe>         <iframe src=""https://101com.com/test.html""></iframe>     </body> </html> ```  With default Brave Shields configuration, the frames show a broken page (or suspicious document warning on 1.23.x with [this PR](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/7952)).  When loading in uBlock Origin, the frames are invisible. When inspecting the page in the devtools console, the same random attribute is assigned to both (ex. `<iframe src=""https://101com.com/test.html"" tr5x7y7vs>`), and a `[tr5x7y7vs] { display: none !important; }` stylesheet is added to the page.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/2715,742003342,Community learning discussion draft,"#1299  This is the first stab at adding community learning to Privacy Badger -- giving users the option to share de-identified information about the trackers they collect with EFF. Users can now choose to opt-in to community learning. Then, whenever Privacy Badger observes a new tracker for the first time, it will share the following information: ``` {   page_host: full domain of the page that the user is on,    tracker_host: full domain of the third-party tracker,    tracking_action: type of action that Privacy Badger observed, one of (""cookie"", ""supercookie"", ""fingerprint""). } ```  Other things: - This is strictly opt-in, and no new data will be shared until a user checks the ""community learning"" box on the options page. - Community learning is separate from local learning: both can be enabled or disabled independently. - Community learning will not occur in incognito windows, even if local learning is enabled in incognito windows. - A random sample of new tracking actions will be reported. The proportion of new trackers reported is controlled by `constants.CL_PROBABILITY`. Right now it's set to 1.0, meaning every action will be reported. - To reduce network load, tracking actions will be reported after a random delay. The length of this delay is controlled by `constants.MAX_CL_WAIT_TIME`, currently set to 5 minutes. - Only trackers which are not already blocked or cookieblocked will be reported. Furthermore, only tracker/page pairs that are not already in the snitch map will be reported. If evil.com has a snitch map entry logging it tracking on example.com in the past, but evil.com is not yet blocked, the evil.com/example.com tracking action will not be reported. - To prevent duplicate reports, tracking actions that do get reported will be stored in an in-memory cache, `HeuristicBlocker.previouslySharedTrackers`. Tracking actions that are already present in the cache will not be reported again. Obviously, when the user restarts their browser, the cache will be cleared, but the goal is just to prevent crazy amounts of dupes. The size of the cache is capped by `constants.CL_CACHE_SIZE`.  This PR makes requests to ""localhost:8080."" If you want, you can set up a toy SQL server to test the logging.  On the server side, tracking actions will be stored in a SQL table that looks like this:  ``` +----+---------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+ | id | time                | page_host                   | tracker_host | tracker_type | +----+---------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+ |  1 | 2020-10-28 10:38:48 | docs.python.org             | www.google.com | cookie       | |  2 | 2020-10-28 10:39:12 | docs.python.org             | adservice.google.com | cookie       | ... ```  The server side is more up in the air, but for now, IP addresses and other identifying information will not be stored. Before this is deployed, we'll have some kind of privacy policy explaining exactly how logs etc. will be handled. We're still thinking through how best to prevent malicious reporting or other kinds of griefing.  We're thinking that the first version of community learning will be for informational purposes only -- the CL database will not automatically populate any block lists. This should reduce the incentive for bad actors to populate the database with bad data. We want to use the data to identify deficiencies in Badger Sett: what domains are we missing? on which domains do we need to crawl more widely? are there places where trackers don't appear unless a user logs in?   Eventually, it might make sense to auto-generate a community learning list, but for now, we just want to see what kind of data people are generating.  Feedback, criticism, concern are welcome. What do you think?",,

Also, we could probably get by with adding [0, 3] additional whitespace characters between UA segments, but again, for the first change, lets be conservative.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/12097,719597018,Fingerprinting 2.0: User Agent - follow up to 9190,"Per https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9190#issuecomment-707172886, https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9190 should be tested with 1.17.x when all of the code has landed.  ### Test plan for both Desktop and Android (per https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9190#issuecomment-703932628):  per @pes10k comment: i've added a user-agent row to https://dev-pages.brave.software/farbling.html  Things to check: 1. using an android device, hit the ""generate fingerprints"" button, then click on one of the hash values in that row and make sure that in the popup it says ""android device"" and not any particular device model 2. in ""strict"" blocking, you should get different fingerprints across top-level origins and sessions (there aren't a huge number of possible random values here, so if you see an identical fingerprint (for the user-agent row only), its worth checking on the [sibling page](https://dev-pages.bravesoftware.com/farbling.html) or on another session to see if you get another fingerprint then)  ### Original issue description  This is a sub-issue of the larger fingerprint defense reorganization issue: #8787  ### User Agent String `NavigatorID.userAgent`  **default protections**: - for devices with OS version numbers, always report `MAX(current minor version number, latest version number as of build)` - (only for android) don't report device name in UA, only return ""android device"" (same as what DDG browser does)  **max protections**: - return chrome default UA for each platform - At end of UA, add [0, 5] additional whitespace characters, as determined by eTLD+1 seed (only for JS reflected value)  (other notes for future consideration) In default mode, we could _probably_ get by safely with adding [0, 5] additional whitespace characters, as determined by eTLD+1 seed (only for JS reflected value), but for the first time out, lets be very very conservative with the UA and not make any ""clever"" changes like that.  Also, we could probably get by with adding [0, 3] additional whitespace characters between UA segments, but again, for the first change, lets be conservative.",,
https://api.github.com/repos/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/7881,718893138,Mute button not working randomly ,"### Description:  There is a major Bug we are seeing in last few weeks on the latest stable release. For some users when they go on mute, we are still able to hear them. No matter how many times they toggle, we can hear them. Interestingly the UI updates properly on both sides with the icon changing from unmute/mute. But the we are able to hear in both the cases. This is seen once in a while (once every 10 calls org so) and not consistently reproduced seen. It goes away on reloading the page and appears randomly after few calls.  ### Steps to reproduce:  1. Join a meeting 2. Click on mute  ### Expected behavior:  On clicking mute, other should not be able to hear my voice.   ### Actual behavior:  On clicking mute, other are able to hear my voice but the UI is updated properly on both sides on toggle.  ### Server information:  - Jitsi Meet version: 4289 - Operating System: Ubuntu   ### Client information:  - Browser / app version: Chrome Version 85 - Operating System: Windows 10  ### Additional information:  This is happening randomly. Initially we thought it was a temporary glitch with poor internet connection. But its happening repeatedly at random meeting & users. Was not able to collect the logs since it was happening to others and not me.  ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/12069,718450236,"When farbling canvas, farble across all channels","**Updated Issue (@pes10k edit)** Currently the canvas farbling only effects one channel.  That channel is determined by the per-eTLD+1, per-session farbling seed, so the channel isn't guessable, but it is probably detectable given a determined attacker.  It might make reversing the canvas farbling slightly more difficult if the farbling was done across all channels, which would make it a bit more difficult for an attacker.  **Original Issue** There is a flaw in canvas randomizing. It's not a security issue. Do you want to discuss it here, or via email, or in a private repo. I'm not talking about the per-origin, per-execution to protect the random seed. It should be a simple fix",,

Use Screenshots if you want. -->  **This is step 2 of 2 to enhance data privacy for embedded content of third party providers. The 1st step is #3657**  Privacy by design:  Third party content providers should not get any user data due to embedded content unless users opt-in - by agreeing to load third party content or unless they click on a link.  ### User Problems <!-- Which problem is this solving? Why do you think this is important? Who will benefit from it and how? -->  Currently, user data is shared with third party providers even if the user has not agreed to display embedded content. This also applies to other providers than those listed in the account settings.  #### For videos:  The embed code shows that the preview image has been loaded from a third party provider.  ![youtube-embed-no-thanks-code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/84916085-e83f6e00-b0bd-11ea-8ea9-b5743dac50a7.png)  For videos, this contradicts to what is shown to the user: ![hc-embedded-content-privacy-notice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/85061751-a2f76b00-b1a7-11ea-987f-97d19b9b95ed.png)  #### Other content:  Content from providers not listed in the account settings is embedded by default too, so user data is disclosed to those providers as well.  ### Implementation <!-- How do you think this feature should be implemented? How will it be used? Where in the network should it be located? Which steps and screens are involved? --> Implement privacy by design and a consistent opt-in policy.  For embedded content if the user disagreed to display embedded content: - [ ] Neither load any data from third party providers nor display it. - [ ] Applies to **all** third party content, not just those providers listed in the account settings. - [ ] Instead show the existing warning box. - [ ] Crop the box to fit the warning content. - [ ] Additionally, show the link to the third party provider's content. - [ ] Change the text, see screenshot: - [ ] If the user agrees the embedded third party load and display the content.  ### Design & Layout <!-- Attach Screenshots and Sketches to illustrate your idea. -->  If the option for displaying embedded content is set to ""No thanks"" show the warning box instead of a content preview:  ![hc-embedded-content-privacy-notice-privacy-by-design-new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/85071817-5b2d0f80-b1b8-11ea-8e45-bf901a0e7d43.png)  If the user clicks on 'Continue' show the embedded content:  ![hc-embedded-content-display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/85065788-13a18600-b1ae-11ea-999e-21be6805a3de.png)  ### Validation <!-- How can we make sure that this feature indeed solves the above problem?

This has been [proposed](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=800329) in Chromium, but appears to be a wontfix as the quota is intended to be kept fully in-memory for private browsing sessions.

Or disable the button altogether when `disableThirdPartyRequests: true` is set?  ### Steps to reproduce:  see description.  ### Expected behavior:  I would like to use the blur feature without establishing connections to Google services.  ### Actual behavior:  see description.  ### Server information:  - Operating System: Debian Buster - Jitsi Meet Version:  2.0.4627-1 (Stable Debian packages)  Nginx Version: 1.14.2-2+deb10u1 :  `add_header Content-Security-Policy  ""connect-src 'self';"";`  ### Client information:  - Browser / app version: Chromium 84.0.4147.89 Arch Linux - Operating System: Arch Linux (latest) ",,

Use Screenshots if you want. -->  **This is step 2 of 2 to enhance data privacy for embedded content of third party providers. The 1st step is #3657**  Privacy by design:  Third party content providers should not get any user data due to embedded content unless users opt-in - by agreeing to load third party content or unless they click on a link.  ### User Problems <!-- Which problem is this solving? Why do you think this is important? Who will benefit from it and how? -->  Currently, user data is shared with third party providers even if the user has not agreed to display embedded content. This also applies to other providers than those listed in the account settings.  #### For videos:  The embed code shows that the preview image has been loaded from a third party provider.  ![youtube-embed-no-thanks-code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/84916085-e83f6e00-b0bd-11ea-8ea9-b5743dac50a7.png)  For videos, this contradicts to what is shown to the user: ![hc-embedded-content-privacy-notice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/85061751-a2f76b00-b1a7-11ea-987f-97d19b9b95ed.png)  #### Other content:  Content from providers not listed in the account settings is embedded by default too, so user data is disclosed to those providers as well.  ### Implementation <!-- How do you think this feature should be implemented? How will it be used? Where in the network should it be located? Which steps and screens are involved? --> Implement privacy by design and a consistent opt-in policy.  For embedded content if the user disagreed to display embedded content: - [ ] Neither load any data from third party providers nor display it. - [ ] Applies to **all** third party content, not just those providers listed in the account settings. - [ ] Instead show the existing warning box. - [ ] Crop the box to fit the warning content. - [ ] Additionally, show the link to the third party provider's content. - [ ] Change the text, see screenshot: - [ ] If the user agrees the embedded third party load and display the content.  ### Design & Layout <!-- Attach Screenshots and Sketches to illustrate your idea. -->  If the option for displaying embedded content is set to ""No thanks"" show the warning box instead of a content preview:  ![hc-embedded-content-privacy-notice-privacy-by-design-new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/85071817-5b2d0f80-b1b8-11ea-8e45-bf901a0e7d43.png)  If the user clicks on 'Continue' show the embedded content:  ![hc-embedded-content-display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17728384/85065788-13a18600-b1ae-11ea-999e-21be6805a3de.png)  ### Validation <!-- How can we make sure that this feature indeed solves the above problem?

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/10101,631360296,"The Brave Browser is vulnerable to CSS Exfiltration attempts, may leak PII.","## Description   The Brave browser is, just like other Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, vulnerable to CSS Exfiltration attempts. This is a very serious privacy threat and should be given the highest priority. Mr. Mike Gualtieri has done research in that area, as described here:  https://www.mike-gualtieri.com/posts/stealing-data-with-css-attack-and-defense  I quote from this link:  _""A method is detailed - dubbed CSS Exfil - which can be used to steal targeted data using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as an attack vector.  Due to the modern web's heavy reliance on CSS, a wide variety of data is potentially at risk, including: usernames, passwords, and sensitive data such as date of birth, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.  The technique can also be used to de-anonymize users on dark nets like Tor. Defense methods are discussed for both website operators as well as web users, and a pair of browser extensions are offered which guard against this class of attack.""_  Everything else is thoroughly explained on the website I just linked to. **This is a grave threat to privacy**, as it bypasses all of Brave's anti-tracking measures and may lead to people being identified even when using Brave's Tor windows (Well, I know that Brave's Tor windows are not comparable to the actual Tor browser, but still, they shouldn't be as easily bypassed as this).  Mr. Gualtieri has created an extension that fends off such attacks, saying that he hopes that browsers will at one point take care of the leak, rendering his extension redundant:  https://github.com/mlgualtieri/CSS-Exfil-Protection  The code of this extension may be an inspiration for a fix on part of the Brave team. I use the extension in Brave (I also allow it in private windows), and I am no longer vulnerable. That being said, since Brave's Tor windows do not allow for extensions to run, I am once again vulnerable when using Tor windows.  ## Steps to Reproduce     1. Go to the following website: https://www.mike-gualtieri.com/css-exfil-vulnerability-tester  ## Actual result:   Brave is vulnerable to CSS Exfiltration attempts.  ## Expected result:  Brave shouldn't be vulnerable to CSS Exfiltration attempts.  ## Reproduces how often:   Easily reproduced.  ## Brave version (brave://version info)  Brave | 1.9.76 Chromium: 81.0.4044.138⁄ ©Official Build®⁄ ©64-bit) -- | -- Revision | 8c6c7ba89cc9453625af54f11fd83179e23450fa-refs/branch-heads/4044@{#999} OS | macOS Version 10.15.5 (Build 19F96)  I use Brave on macOS, but it is reproducible on all OSes, including Android.  ## Version/Channel Information:  I use the stable channel, but it is reproducible on all channels.  ## Other Additional Information:  Is the issue reproducible on the latest version of Chrome?   Yes.  ## Miscellaneous Information:  Please give this a very high priority, private information may be leaked by Brave despite all of its protective measures, CSS Exfiltration also compromises the anonymity of Brave's Tor windows. It might also be a good idea to contribute any†fix you might create to Chromium upstream, and the team behind the Tor browser should perhaps be informed.  ",,

Could be someone who got the link by accident or enumerated the meeting link. You now have unauthorized users in the meeting with access to everyone's audio/video even though the meeting should be password protected. Therefore, password protection is defeated by simply showing up early to the meeting.  enumeration is unlikely if you generate random room names (not really a built in option at this moment) but a lot of people are using room names like ""familyChat"" or whatever, so enumeration is pretty trivial. but even if we have strong and random meeting room names, (ie. jitsi.example.com/a6f9c2b6e1dd) we still want to protect against the link being shared with the wrong people  ---  ## Current behavior  Once the host authenticates, all users waiting for host are automatically placed in meeting without inputting password  ---  ## Expected Behavior  Password should be enforced on ALL users in the meeting, even those who were already waiting for start  ---  ## Possible Solution BEFORE meeting becomes active, host should have the option to enter password, or make the meeting unprotected.   THEN the meeting should become active, and those waiting for meeting start must enter the password, or meeting should start if no password required  ---  ## Steps to reproduce  - setup authentication on prosody - have one or more users waiting for a meeting to start BEFORE the host arrives - authenticate as host using auth set up in prosody - meeting then starts immediately - admin can still set up password, but anyone who was already waiting for the meeting is already in the meeting with access to everyone's video/audio streams  ---  # Environment details  debian 10 buster stable, 4.19 kernel nginx 1.14.2 jitsi-meet  2.0.4384 prosody 0.11.2  tested on clients: jitsi android, chrome windows, chromium debian, firefox win/debian  --- ",,

Since Brave made this decision, Chromium has gotten tighter with its handling of the [referrer header](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6251880185331712).  Basically, they have a default of `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`; sites who want the previous, more permissive behavior need to opt in.  To reduce the webcompat cost, but still aggressively protect user privacy, we should:  1. Use Chromium's behavior as the default 2. Respect when sites specify a more restrictive policy (e.g. `no-referrer`) 3. Treat less restrictive policies as `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` 4. Never send referrer for insecure requests  E.g. 1. Set effective policy to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. 2. Is this a cross-site navigation?    - `GET` / `HEAD`?      - If yes, change effective policy to `no-referrer`    - Otherwise:      - Requested policy of `origin`?        - If yes, change effective policy to `strict-origin`      - Requested policy of `no-referrer`, `same-origin`, or `strict-origin`?        - If yes, change effective policy to the requested policy.  3. Is this a sub-resource or iframe request?    - Requested policy of `origin`?      - If yes, change effective policy to `strict-origin`    - Requested policy of `no-referrer`, `same-origin`, or `strict-origin`?      - If yes, change effective policy to the requested policy.

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/8419,571672768,Wayback machine feature should be disabled in Tor windows or use Tor,"### Problem  As reported in https://bravesoftware.slack.com/archives/C85NV6NSG/p1582256790113900 (see thread), we found that clicking the ""Checked for saved version"" button on a 404 page in a Tor window will send a request to `https://brave-api.archive.org/...` that doesn't go through Tor. As such, this is a privacy problem.  ## Expected behavior  1. open a Tor window 2. go to https://brave.com/dfkdfjd 3. either you should **not** see a notification bar that offers to check the Wayback machine or you should see this, and clicking on the button to check the Wayback machine does not issue a request that goes over plain TLS. (check for it in a request inspector like Wireshark)  ## What about private windows?  I think this feature is probably ok to keep in private windows because it uses a network context that doesn't store state on disk (https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/net/system_network_context_manager.h?q=systemnetwork&sq=package:chromium&g=0&l=44-45) and we disallow cookies (https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/3561/files#diff-306f17e629f5adfd7444084d21b89193R38) for it.  However if the fix is easier to do with it disabled entirely in private windows (Tor windows included), I am pro doing that.  ## underlying cause  The system network context (https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/3561/files#diff-6d51337a3d8e25d0c3fbb40ef046dce9R58) doesn't use the Tor window proxy setting.",,

This is a potential privacy issue for my work, since this could load a photo of the previous user if that was their last active costume. We teach children and adults about coding in different locations each day, so could potentially have 5 year olds taking photos in Scratch one day, and those photos be accessed by adults the next day.  Currently the only way to prevent this from happening is to fully quit the app and launch it again. Since it seems to not be clearing information with a new project as expected, I believe it may be related to another low priority issue I reported #56  as well as the issue of project names not resetting #71   ### Steps to Reproduce  1.

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/7956,556433667,Disable Reporting API,"Chromium includes a system called Reporting API.  Its a broad API that is currently used to allow sites to instruct the browser to send at least the following types of information (possibly others) to arbitrary parties (i.e. first or 3p):  - CSP errors - [Network errors](https://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/) - Interventions (e.g. webRequest blocked something) - Crash reports  Most of the functionality is all defined though HTTP headers, though there is a JS API that allows the site to see and edit reports as they go out).  There is a compile time flag to disable Reporting API.  We should do this.  Of the functionality that goes through Reporting API, two have possible use cases (CSP and crash reports, though Brave opinions differ on whether they're user-respecting to have on by default), and two are clearly privacy harming (network error reporting, that is a clear tracking vector, and intervention reporting, which is obviously horrible).  Regardless of whether we decide to enable CSP and crash reports, there won't be resources to do so for a while.  There is an ""easy"" way to disable the entire ""parent"" API (reporting API).  We should do so ASAP, until there are resources to possibly re-enable the non-privacy harming parts.

Add a privacy selection field to the user settings to let the user chose his default. - [ ] 3. Restrict access to private posts for other users. More detailed: Exclude privat posts from the post feed, from search query, unlogged requests, and search engines. - [ ] 4. Restrict 'Registered' posts to registered users. - [ ] 5. Make 'Public' post visible for unregistered users and search engines. - [ ] 6. When coosing at least one category, the post is automatically public.  ### Design & Layout Make a post visible for the public, when category is set: ![post-public](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457963/75771682-c6a6ba80-5d4a-11ea-91f3-0c906a2fe56c.png) Make a post visible just for connections, if no category is set: ![post-conn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457963/75771725-d7efc700-5d4a-11ea-9ea9-8a5b9eab26c3.png) Menu with more options (Draft and Registered): ![post-opt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457963/75771778-edfd8780-5d4a-11ea-8938-4335ed360f5f.png)  ### Additional context <!-- Add other context or background about the feature request here.-->  - Old already closed issue is #784 . - @roschaefer startet a PR on this #3169 . - A related issue is as well #288 .",,

Onion endpoints are needed for: - Electrum endpoint - LndHub endpoint  How? Orbot is not available for iOS, right!? Have a look at the Blockstream Green Wallet, which comes with native Tor support for iOS and Android now. Tor support is implemented in their cross-platform GDK (Greenwallet Development Kit): https://github.com/Blockstream/gdk  The suggestion is to look at the Blockstream approach to ship Tor natively in the app instead of using Orbot, which would be available on Android only.  Here are more details on the GDK Tor implementation: - Tor is compiled from the sources at build time: https://github.com/Blockstream/gdk/blob/master/tools/buildtor.sh - Wrapper for iOS (Swift): https://github.com/Blockstream/gdk/blob/master/src/swift/GreenAddress/Sources/GreenAddress/GreenAddress.swift - Wrapper for Android (JNI/SWIG): https://github.com/Blockstream/gdk/tree/master/src/swig_java",,

Before submitting this issue, please check the open issues and add a note before logging a new issue.   PLEASE USE THE TEMPLATE BELOW TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUE.  INSUFFICIENT INFO WILL GET THE ISSUE CLOSED. IT WILL ONLY BE REOPENED AFTER SUFFICIENT INFO IS PROVIDED-->  Edit: Updated the initial report.  ## Description  <!--Provide a brief description of the issue--> This one of a few issues that prevents me from switching to Brave full time. Whenever I ever encountered an issue caused by ad filtering (aka issue goes away if network filtering is disabled), I always open Developer tools Network tab and uBlock Origin filter log and see what caused it. Currently, Brave shows blocked requests on the Network as if they were resolved with successfully (200) and had no content and only had headers (irrespective of the actual request type, it seems): > Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * > Content-Type: text/html  This is a bit misleading and would be nice to have blocked requests as such in the table. Currently, the only way to know that a request is blocked is to check: 1. ""Connection ID"" is ""0"" because there was no actual network request 2. ""Size"" is ""0"", and ""0 B transferred over network, resource size: 0 B"" to make sure the request was  not served from cache.  The only alternative way to view the blocked requests is via the Shields extension, which is inconvenient because: 1. The window is tiny so viewing the list is nearly impossible. 2. A lot of important information is missing that is shown on uBlock Origin log:    - the rule that matched the URL and caused it to be blocked    - the name of the filter list the rule came from, aka where to report the incorrectly blocked content for a fix    - the type of the request (this is usually is a guess, since Content-Type response header is not available because there is no response, but it's very helpful anyway)    - first- or third-party status of the request (this is determined by uBlock Origin based on hosts) 3. A lot of important information is missing that is shown on Developer Tools Betwork pane as a separate column and can be sorted on:    - domain    - size    - timing (both time column and waterfall)    - initiator    - HTTP headers    - HTTP method    - etc.  FYI, I have seen a lot of people on https://www.reddit.com/r/brave_browser recommend using Brave and uBlock Origin together because of Brave's limited functionality. I personally don't do this because I don't want to use two network filters doing the same exact thing at the same time.  ## Steps to Reproduce <!--Please add a series of steps to reproduce the issue-->     1. Open a site, e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/brave_browser    2. Open Shields, open Cross-site trackers blocked, see that:        - to view complete log one would have to scroll, sometimes both horizontally and vertically        - there is no information which rule matched        - there is no separate column for information about request type, domain, etc.    3. Open uBlock Origin and logger and see much more convenient UI  ## Actual result: <!--Please add screenshots if needed--> ![shields](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45960703/66936267-f15ad580-f02c-11e9-8537-18027067dee7.png)  ![brave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45960703/66705890-07f6e900-ed1c-11e9-874c-7ae02c795dfb.png)  ## Expected result: N/A  ## Reproduces how often:  <!--[Easily reproduced/Intermittent issue/No steps to reproduce]--> Always.  ## Brave version (brave://version info) <!--For installed build, please copy Brave, Revision and OS from brave://version and paste here.

Display requests blocked by adblock component in red because they were blocked. 2. Add an extra column called ""Interventions"" that displays if the blocker or HTTPS Everywhere had edited this request. 3. Add a checkbox to Developer Tools Network pane called ""Hide blocked requests"" to hide the blocked requests. This checkbox would be located near the ""Hide data URLs"".",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/5614,479117208,Randomize non-webcompat FP values to prevent fingerprinting,"Currently our main approach for protecting against fingerprinting is to try and make web api endpoint values as predictable as possible, to try and keep users in as large an anonymity set as possible.  This is probably the right ""fundamental"" approach, but its got problems: 1) Takes lots of engineering time and we're getting out run by new FP-contributing endpoints 2)There are lots of places where creating predictable / constant results of FP surface will break sites  We should take the opposite approach, at least for the medium term: Identify values used in creating fingerprints that can be modified (w/in some range) and intentionally vary those.  Instead of shooting for putting all users in as-large-as-possible-an-anonymity set, this would instead aim to put all users in a constantly changing anonymity set of 1.  The approach has the downsides of being circumventable by attackers (just remove those values from their FP generation techniques) but, even then we get the win of removing FP surface.  Possible areas: - minor version numbers for OS and browser in UA (easy) - Sentographic style manipulations to Web Audio and Canvas APIs (difficult) - values for deviceMemory, maxConcurrency, etc (easy) - plugins (e.g. injecting made up plugins) (easy)  Existing work in the area: Nikiforakis, Nick, Wouter Joosen, and Benjamin Livshits.

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/5374,472451957,WebTorrent: Brave should connect to WebRTC torrent peers,"## Description  <!--Provide a brief description of the issue-->  When a torrent has WebRTC peers, Brave should attempt to use them. WebRTC connections have the following advantages over traditional TCP connections:  - WebRTC connections are **end-to-end encrypted**. (The status quo in most clients is TCP or uTP connections, which are unencrypted.) - More peers means increased download speed and improved ""torrent health"". - Some content may only have WebRTC peers, i.e. torrents seeded from sites like https://instant.io. Brave will now be able to consume content from this class of torrents.  WebRTC connections have the following disadvantages:  - They consume more CPU and network resources per connection than TCP since WebRTC is a more complicated protocol. Standards bodies are discussing lighter-weight alternatives to WebRTC, but those are a ways off for now.  We initially shipped WebTorrent integration in Brave with WebRTC⁄ disabled because it made the implementation easier. At the time, Brave was built on Electron and WebTorrent was running in a Node.js process which lacked WebRTC support out the box. This is no longer the case. WebTorrent is now running a Chrome extension context, so we just need to change an config option to get WebRTC support for free.  Note: WebRTC will be only used when the `.torrent` file or magnet URI contains WebTorrent-style tracker servers (with the `ws://` or `wss://` protocols) which indicates†that the torrent may have WebRTC peers. **So, this changes nothing for torrents which include no WebTorrent-style trackers.**  ## Steps to Reproduce <!--Please add a series of steps to reproduce the issue-->     1. Go to https://instant.io and drop any file onto the page to create a torrent and start seeding it    2. Right click the ""[Magnet URI]"" link and ""Copy Link Address"" to the clipboard    3. Open a new tab and navigate to the copied magnet URI.    4. Tell Brave to start torrenting.    5. See that nothing is downloaded.  ## Actual result: <!--Please add screenshots if needed-->  WebTorrent in Brave is unable to connect to WebRTC peers, even when the `.torrent` file or magnet URI specifically indicates the possible presence of WebRTC peers.  ## Expected result:  WebTorrent in Brave should connect to WebRTC peers.  ## Reproduces how often:  <!--[Easily reproduced/Intermittent issue/No steps to reproduce]--> Easily reproduced   ## Brave version (brave://version info) <!--For installed build, please copy Brave, Revision and OS from brave://version and paste here.

Before submitting this issue, please check the open issues and add a note before logging a new issue.   PLEASE USE THE TEMPLATE BELOW TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUE.  INSUFFICIENT INFO WILL GET THE ISSUE CLOSED. IT WILL ONLY BE REOPENED AFTER SUFFICIENT INFO IS PROVIDED-->  ## Description  <!--Provide a brief description of the issue--> I came to Brave from Chrome, were I used the strategy of managing my cookies this way: All the next processes are made on cookies section of site settings page (brave://settings/content/cookies). I block all cookies by default. If the site I visit needs auth for a long time (for example gmail.com), I add the site domain to ""allow"" section. If the visited site needs cookies for a while (some sites doesn't work without localStorage/cookies), I add the site domain to the ""clear on exit"" section. This way there are no garbage at ""All cookies and site data"" page (brave://settings/siteData). The Brave has shield which is nice but it ignores my site settings. The main idea is to use ""clear on exit"" functionality, which allows to keep cookies storage in clean state (on browser restart there will be only ""allowed sites"" cookies). I could use ""Clear browsing data on exit"", but it would also clear cookies of ""allowed"" sites.  ## Steps to Reproduce <!--Please add a series of steps to reproduce the issue-->     1. Go to the site settings -> cookies (brave://settings/content/cookies)    2. Set cookies as blocked (Brave shield still has ""block 3rd party cookies"" option selected)    3. Go to any website that uses cookies, for example https://2ip.io  ## Actual result: <!--Please add screenshots if needed--> Cookies for the site you visited were saved (if ""block 3rd party cookies"" option is selected in the shield), you can convinced of it here: brave://settings/siteData If the shield mode is ""block all cookies"", then cookies will not be saved at all, even if you add the site domain to ""allow""/""clear on exit"" section of the site settings page. It just ignores site settings.  ## Expected result: If all the cookies are disabled (not only via Brave shield but also via site settings), then all the cookies except of ""allowed""/""clear on exit"" domains should be blocked despite the Brave shield settings. If the site domain is in list of ""allowed"" domains, then Brave shield shouldn't block that cookies. If the site domain is in list of ""blocked"" domains, Brave should block that cookies. Same works if all cookies are blocked and domain is not either in ""allow"" or ""clear on exit"" domain list. If the site domain is in list of ""clear on exit"" domains, Brave shouldn't block that cookies and should clear that cookies on exit.  In total: site settings should have priority to the Brave shield cookies settings. If the Brave shield mode is ""block 3rd party cookies"", then it still should block 3rd party cookies (despite the site settings). (In the ideal world there should be a list of allowed 3rd party domains).   ## Reproduces how often:  <!--[Easily reproduced/Intermittent issue/No steps to reproduce]--> Easily reproduced   ## Brave version (brave://version info) <!--For installed build, please copy Brave, Revision and OS from brave://version and paste here.

It should be trivial to remove or polyfill. A good candidate for dummy values is provided in the official polyfill: https://github.com/WICG/keyboard-map/blob/master/keyboard-polyfill.js  Note that `navigator.keyboard` also includes `navigator.keyboard.lock` defined in [Keybard Lock API](https://wicg.github.io/keyboard-lock/) -- a related API introduced at the same time (and apparently with similarly small adoption).  #### WICG Keyboard Map Draft recommendations Excerpt from [here](https://wicg.github.io/keyboard-map/#privacy): > 6.1. Privacy Mitigations > User agents that are concerned about the privacy impact of providing this keyboard mapping information can also consider the following mitigations: > > Having a user prompt to ask for permission whenever a site attempts to use this API. > > Always return a ""standard"" mapping. Although note that the standard mapping would need to vary for different parts of the world. For example, a user agent that had a ""privacy mode"" that always returned a US-QWERTY layout mapping would actually be providing more identifying information for users in the UK than the actual mapping would (since most users in the UK do not use a US layout). > > 6.2.

(like we do with ""share without URL"" for example). I'm OK about doing this logic in a follow-up.  Although, I think it would be nice if we could avoid doing this as it adds another button the UI, and the profile is already shared publicly. I'm filing this here for discussion as a follow-up.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/issues/1734,424365653,Delete personal information from transactions (manual and automatic),"Peronal information is given to sellers on orders, the most important being shipping information and contact information. This information is only needed while an order is open. Once an order is completed, the personal information should be deleted.  There are two methods I can see:  1. Have a button labeled ""Delete Buyer's Information"" that allows the seller to manually delete the information involved in a transaction. 2. Automatically delete this data once a transaction has completed.  Combining them both would work, allowing sellers to delete sensitive information as soon as they complete orders, but also having that happen automatically when the order is done.  At the very least the shipping and contact information should be deleted. It's possible the order chat messaging should be as well.",,

This potentially reduces buyer privacy as well as creating a link between vendor and buyer (vendor IP address linked to buyer physical address).  It would be better to switch this feature to a provider with more focus on privacy, such as Open Street Maps. However, [their policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy#Data_we_receive_automatically) does have them logging data temporarily.  Ideally this feature would be removed.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/3855,424337670,Reduce the trackability of QUIC connections,"In #190, we decided not to disable QUIC and looking at `chrome://flags/#enable-quic`, it is set to the default value (there is also an [enterprise policy](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#QuicAllowed) for it). Loading <https://maps.google.com> with the devtools open, I can see in the network tab (""protocol"" column) that we're making `http/2+quic/43` connections.  In light of [recently published research](https://svs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/publications/2019/2019-02-26-Sy-PET_Symposium-A_QUIC_Look_at_Web_Tracking.pdf), we should probably add a few mitigations to reduce web servers' ability to track using the QUIC protocol.  Here are some proposed mitigations based on the above paper:  - respect `server-config` expiry but cap it to:   - 60 min (or 24h if 60 min is too aggressive) for first-party connections   - 10 min for third-party connections - ignore `server-config` update messages - clear `source-address` tokens when:   - IP address changes   - `server-config` is cleared",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/3725,421332412,"Unable to use microphone (affects Duolingo, Google Translate, and other sites)","## Latest status (this comment edited by @bsclifton) This feature relies on a Speech API key that we would need to create and pay for on a per-use basis. [As captured below](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/3725#issuecomment-506915890), @tomlowenthal has looked at this.  At the moment, this is on hold. We have some other features requiring this speech to text API also. But we haven't taken any action as creating a token and installing will have a cost associated with it.   ## Original issue details by @MGRussell This issue was previously opened in the browser-laptop repo [here](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/4476) and was archived without resolution with numerous OS/versions chiming in. I am reopening it here, and reporting with Windows 7 with Brave Version 0.61.51 Chromium: 73.0.3683.75 (Official Build) (64-bit). [This](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/2802) may be a related issue which mentions that Webspeech API is disabled within Brave.   ## Description  The browser does not function properly with Duolingo. The site asks for permission to use the microphone and everything seems to work fine, but it seems no input is ever being sent from brave to the site. The site only officially supports chrome and so this is something that would need to be remedied on Brave's end, if the browser is to be capable of using Duolingo.  ## Steps to Reproduce The browser fails on any tests from Duolingo that asks the user to send voice data, 100% of the time.  ### Website problems only:   The issue does not resolve when disabling brave shields. This issue is not present on the latest version of Chrome.   ",,

You might select a sentence in an article, but the publication's name and URL are appended to the paste-buffer. Or you attempt to copy a link and your copied link has an unique token or redirect added to it to trace sharing.  ## Steganography/tagging The text appears to be ordinary sentences or paragraphs*, but Unicode homoglyphs, complex whitespace, or zero-width characters, are used to uniquely mark the copied text. If pasted without recognition or conversion, the attacker can determine which unique source or visitor the paste came from.   ## Paste-jacking Innocuous terminal commands are presented, with the expectation that they'll be copied and run, perhaps with elevated privileges.

Toggling on the Block Scripts shield does not disable JavaScript. This happens even after reloading the page several times after toggling the switch.  ## Steps to Reproduce    1. Open a new window and navigate to https://enable-javascript.com/    2. Click the Brave Shields button and toggle on Block Scripts.  ## Actual result: Despite Block Scripts being enabled, JavaScript is still enabled.

When you connect to a domain over TLS, your browser creates a session ticket (or ID) with an expiration time -- in Firefox, 1 day by default. If you connect to the same domain again before the ticket expires, your browser will send that ticket instead of going through the normal TLS handshake, allowing the server to tie your request to your previous visits, no cookies required.   Tor Browser turned this off by default a long time ago: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4099  Firefox also has a (secret) option to turn this off, see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967977. I think we should have Privacy Badger disable it by default.   Afaik Chrome doesn't let the user control this.

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/brave-browser/issues/811,353059219,Tor beyond private tabs,"[Transplanted from brave/browser-laptop#14649.]  We initially implemented support for Tor in private tabs on the premise that Tor is necessary to provide the 'privacy' that it seems a majority of users expect 'private tabs' to convey.  However, total anonymity against all actors involved -- the next person on the computer you're using, your ISP, the remote host -- is not the only value of Tor.  - Some users are _not_ concerned about the next person on the computer, which is the threat that traditional 'private tabs' defends against.   - Example: I'm a user with a private laptop that I don't share with anyone.  I want to keep my browsing history, my notes, my identities, &c. -- I just don't want my ISP or the remote hosts to track me. - Some users just want to browse .onion sites seamlessly.   - https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/806 - Some users want Tor to thwart their ISP's censorship resistance (e.g.: https://community.brave.com/t/use-tor-in-standard-tabs/26916).   - Example: I'm a user on a network that tries to restrict controversial political content which I want to research.  It blocks some VPNs, but it doesn't block Tor, or it doesn't block bridges, or it doesn't block some pluggable transport that someone has set up with Tor.   - (We will also want bridges or pluggable transports for that: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/811) - Some users want Tor for anonymity from the remote host.  (This is the one we catered to first.)   - Example: I'm reading articles about medical conditions, and I don't want Google or WebMD to build up a profile of what medical conditions or my friends or family might have.   - Example: I'm reading articles in a newspaper, and I want to support them with Brave Payments, but I don't want them to build or sell a profile of what articles I'm interested in -- after all, Brave Payments is supposed to enable me to provide anonymous contributions to the publisher. - Some users want Tor to thwart their ISP's surveillance, e.g. data mining for profit done by ISPs.   - Example: I'm an American who is upset about internet regulations and the obscene power of the duopolistic ISPs unfettered by now-defunct FCC privacy rules where my market choice is between data mining over television cable or data mining over copper wire. - Some users want Tor for _location_ privacy from the remote host, while they still log into the remote host.   - Example: I'm a member of a community in a social networking site that's not high-security -- that can leak users' IP addresses sometimes.  I do want to log into the site, but I don't want a stalker to find me, either by breaking into the site or by sniffing the wifi at the public library -- so it's location privacy, not exactly anonymity, that I'm interested in. - Some users want Tor for _uncorrelated identities_ when logging into a remote host, which requires isolated Tor circuits and state in different sessions.   - Example: I want to make a parody Twitter account of a public figure, but I don't want it to be correlated with my work Twitter account or my personal Twitter account -- and I want to make sure that even someone who gets login records from Twitter with IP addresses won't be able to use them to find me. - Some users may want Tor for _specific sites_ for any or all of these security properties.   - Example: I want to use Tor for Twitter isolated from YouTube, but I want to watch YouTube videos over the normal internet.  The initial idea was 'new Tor tab'.  What we first implemented was a toggle switch to make private tabs 'really private' the way the majority of users seem to expect them, rather than impose the jargon 'new Tor tab' on them.  Then we switched to 'new private tab' vs 'new private tab with Tor' so that users could have control over which private tabs get to use Tor.  This design is still in flux.  This is an issue to track these design decisions.  I offer these user profiles as examples that we might want to support.  (This is aside from background tasks for which, in the future, we might want to use Tor, e.g. version updates, ledger operations, &c.)",,

https://api.github.com/repos/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/2023,323069732,Prevent longitudinal data collection,"This idea is a hybrid of several others, but I thought I'd throw it out there in case it interests someone.  I do recognize that it not simple, but I think it would add a lot of value.  One kind of data collection which is possible, and I expect first-party cookie sites do, is collect information about visitors over time.  For example, a news site might keep a log of all articles read by a given client, based on a persistent cookie returning over and over again, even if there's no account or login.  If at any time this record can ever be correlated with a real person, the whole history is now attributed.  On the other hand, if I have an account on a site, blocking cookies isn't going to help me much with privacy.  If I log into an account to access a news site or an online store, even if I aggressively block cookies (and the site still works...), the site can still use my account to collect data longitudinally.  So here's what I have in mind: * Make most cookies session cookies to start with. * Keep track of tabs which store first party cookies.  When the last tab for a cookie is closed, remove the cookies.  Outright blocking is problematic, as many sites will break if there are no cookies, but they don't need them any longer than the tabs are open.  For people like me who may leave a browser open for weeks, this prevents session cookies from being used for longitudinal tracking, too. * If a site receives a password, then mark that site as being allowed to store persistent cookies, since people like being able to stay logged in, and there is little additional privacy benefit to deleting them.  This will probably require some heuristics similar to those used by password managers.  One likely heuristic is if the site has a <input type=""password""> field in a form, and that form is ever submitted, then it should be marked. * There should be a whitelisting option to mark sites for which the heuristics don't work right.  Maybe this can share the same whitelist which already exists.  I see two main benefits: * This significantly limits the lifetime of cookies which may harm the user, while still allowing cookies which are more likely to benefit them, or at least aren't likely to create additional privacy risk. * Since basically every site on the Internet saves cookies, the cookie database becomes a record of every site ever visited.  This can be a privacy concern in itself.  But people authenticate to only a small fraction of the sites they may visit; the above heuristics would automatically remove most of these sites from the cookie database.  Thanks!",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/browser-laptop/issues/12632,288275550,Privacy issue: Browser connects to third party hosts in the background.,"### Description Brave browser shows non privacy respecting behavior disregarding user settings.  ### Steps to Reproduce  Downloading Brave for the first time, never used before.  1. `wget https://laptop-updates.brave.com/latest/linux64 -O- | tar xj` 2. Turn off any additional network services such as ntpd and similar (to prevent ""poluting"" the tcpdump monitoring with external data) 3. Reboot and login to Plasma desktop (openSUSE Leap 42.3). Do not start any applications. 4. In a console run: `# tcpdump -i eth1 -l > /tmp/tcpdump.log & tail -f /tmp/tcpdump.log`  **Actual result:**  Lots of communication not explicitly initiated by the user with hosts like: ``` amazonaws.com herokudns.com analytics.brave.com mercury.basicattentiontoken.org qwant.com twitter.com yandex.com ocsp.digicert.com phicdn.net fastly.net ```  **Expected result:** No packets should be sent without user initiating that.  **Reproduces how often:** Always  ### Brave Version ``` Brave: 0.19.131  rev: da2f34787e51eb44190a7a77249e100fb2368306  Muon: 4.5.36  libchromiumcontent: 63.0.3239.132  V8: 6.3.292.49  Node.js: 7.9.0  Update Channel: Release  OS Platform: Linux  OS Release: 4.4.104-39-default  OS Architecture: x64 ```  ### Additional Information  Further testing:  5. Changing settings in an attempt to harden privacy:  * about:preferences#general  Brave starts with: a new tab A new tab shows: Blank page My home page is: about:blank Enable Spell Check: OFF  * about:preferences#search  Search engine: DDG. Use DuckDuckGo by default for search in Private Tabs: ON  * about:preferences#security  Password Manager: Don't manage my passwords Enable Autofill: OFF Autoplay Media: Always deny (was 'Always allow') Send a 'Do Not Track' header with browsing requests *: ON Enhance security by loading each site in its own process (experimental) *: ON Autoplay Media(Clear all): cleared  * about:preferences#extensions  Disable all (PDF Viewer and Torrent Viewer are enabled by default). There are 8 extensions total, none of them seems possible to uninstall.  * about:preferences#shields  Cookie Control: Block all cookies Block Scripts (will break many sites): ON Fingerprinting Protection (may break some sites): ON  * about:adblock  All lists are turned off - I leave it this way  * about:preferences#advanced  * Send anonymous crash reports to Brave: OFF  6. Clear all site data, reboot the OS. 7. Start `tcpdump` and run brave:  ``` 00:11:40.843723 IP pc.47245 > rt.domain: 23770+ A? wpad.domain.

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/browser-laptop/issues/12631,288275099,WebTorrent should warn users of potential privacy risks,"Currently WebTorrent is integrated into Brave as an on-by-default extension. There are a couple of risks, such as:  1. ISPs can in theory distinguish WebTorrent traffic and issue copyright notices to users who are torrenting. 2. It is easy for an attacker to track what public IP addresses have downloaded which files over WebTorrent.  3. WebTorrent uses WebRTC, which may leak your local IP address.  (2) is probably the biggest concern. It means that if you click on a .torrent or magnet file in Brave, you are at risk of publicly broadcasting that your IP address is downloading that file (or the IP address of your VPN, etc.). This may not be a concern for users who are torrenting .ISO files or the full text of wikipedia or other such non-sensitive content, but it may present a serious privacy hazard for people who are downloading things like adult content.  I think our options are:  1. Keep WebTorrent enabled by default, but show a disclaimer about the privacy risks of torrenting before the torrent starts. 2. Disable WebTorrent by default, and assume that the users who enable it are aware of the privacy risks.  cc @flamsmark @feross @dcposch ",,

We have received a lot of feedback and bug reports that we have closed as duplicates. Before submitting this issue, please visit our community site for common ones: https://community.brave.com/c/common-issues -->  ### Description <!-- -->  Brave reports the User-Agent as Chrome, but reports certain fingerprintable attributes differently. This can make Brave users easily distinguishable from Chrome users. 1. Brave's header reports the Accept-Language as `en-US`, whereas Chrome's header reports `en-US,en;q=0.9`.  2. Brave reports an empty list of plugins, but Chrome does not.   The bits of entropy leaked by these attributes on Brave is misleading. While the values of the headers and the plugins that Brave exposes are very common, their combination with User-Agent set to Chrome makes the fingerprint unique.   A possible alternative may be to report Chrome's header values and Chrome's default plugin list, which is ['Chrome PDF Plugin', 'Chrome PDF Viewer', 'Native Client', 'Widevine Content Decryption Module'] on macOS and Ubuntu.   ### Steps to Reproduce <!-- Please add a series of steps to reproduce the problem.

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/browser-laptop/issues/12110,277158357,Fingerprinting protections bypassable via window.open,"### Description Similar to #11683, fingerprinting protections can be bypassed by opening up a new window with `window.open` grabbing the references to the blocked fingerprinting methods off the window object before the extension / content script / `document_start` extension hook fires in the new window's context.  This vulnerability is less serious than #11683, since the user has to have granted to page the ability to open popup windows.  But once the user does, the page can escalate that privilege to fingerprint the user.  ### Steps to Reproduce ``` // This will be a reference to a function that blocks the page's finger printing attempt. let blockedGetImageData = CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.getImageData;  let newWindow = window.open(""//"" + window.location.hostname);  // If the user has allowed the page to open popup windows, `notBlockedGetImageData` // will be a referenced to the original, DOM provided methods, that is not blocked let notBlockedGetImageData = newWindow.CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.getImageData; ```  **Actual result:** `notBlockedGetImageData` in the above example is a reference to the original `CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.getImageData` method.   **Expected result:** `notBlockedGetImageData` in the above example should be a reference to the extension injected blocking function / proxy object.  **Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time   ### Brave Version  **about:brave info:** `d4b94c6` (and also master)  **Reproducible on current live release:** yes  ### Additional Information This would be fixed by #12045 too.

In this case I'm not much worried. I'm inclined to trust Kapersky Labs who run the Threatpost site & telling them I'm following a link from their email does not seem much of a hazard anyway.  In other cases it may matter more. For example, I am an admin on the travel guide site wikivoyage.org and have several times removed ?referrer= tags in URLs for hotels & restaurants, preventing some editors from trying to get commission when someone clicks on the link.  I'd like a switch that would make the badger delete everything after a '?' character in every URL, or a pointer to some other Firefox add-on that will do that.

This may unintentionally expose data/metadata to third party services on the page attempting to profile the user, particularly when those third party services have not yet been identified by Brave or its components. Browsing data added to the nonprivate session by this type of event is also retained until the nonprivate session data (using this as an all inclusive reference to history, cache, cookies, etc,) is deleted, even with the strictest privacy and security settings, making it difficult to visit a link shared elsewhere without contaminating or exposing existing browsing data by implicit consent.  The following options (and the behaviors described) added to the security tab can prevent this:  - Start Brave in Private Mode -  When enabled, Brave will open in Private mode by default. Data from Private tabs is deleted when the browser closes and not shared with the data from a non-private session.  - Private Tab Sessions - Browsing data from a Private tab is not shared with other private tabs.

This could put people's privacy at risk. Let me tell you what I mean:  On web pages like [this BrowserLeaks page](https://browserleaks.com/webrtc) and [this JSFiddle page](https://jsfiddle.net/22e4yfvg/), multimedia device information can be displayed. In my case, I'm running Ubuntu with a non-default PulseAudio output device, and because of this, I have one device labeled ""LADSPA Plugin Multiband EQ on Built-in Audio Analog Stereo"", and another labeled ""Built-in Audio Analog Stereo"". The DeviceID changes when I close my browser (I have my browser set to delete all info on closing), but the label (e.g. ""LADSPA Plugin Multiband EQ on Built-in Audio Analog Stereo"") does not change (why would it?).  This could make it easy to track my activities, as it (semi-)uniquely distinguishes me. This is especially bad because I semi-frequently change IP addresses. Because I mostly use this browser on a laptop, I sometimes use public WiFi to connect to the internet. I also frequently use VPN services, proxies, and TOR, to protect my anonymity, especially on public WiFi. That said, I don't want to be de-anonymized by my web browser's MultiMedia label leaks. The worst part is the fact that I'm probably not the only one who could be identified this way, since other users might have (semi-)unique device labels as well.  So, if these labels could be removed, that would be absolutely great.  It's worth noting that in Chromium my devices are just called ""N/A"" on BrowserLeaks and "":"" on JSFiddle, which leads me to assume that what I'm asking is more-or-less possible.  PS: I'm running version 0.12.15, if that makes any difference.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/brave/browser-laptop/issues/7119,205988682,enable Do Not Track (DNT) by default?,"according to https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/:  > The goal of this protocol is to allow a user to express their personal preference regarding tracking to each server and web application that they communicate with via HTTP, thereby allowing recipients of that preference to adjust tracking behavior accordingly or to reach a separate agreement with the user that satisfies all parties.  > Key to that notion of expression is that the signal sent must reflect the user's preference, not the choice of some vendor, institution, site, or network-imposed mechanism outside the user's control; this applies equally to both the general preference and exceptions. The basic principle is that a tracking preference expression is only transmitted when it reflects a deliberate choice by the user. In the absence of user choice, there is no tracking preference expressed.   @pde believes that it would be standards-compliant for Brave to enable DNT=1 by default, since we are a privacy tool that does our best effort to block tracking; therefore a user who installs Brave is expressing a preference to not be tracked.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/Openki/Openki/issues/633,197631545,Remove incognito feature,"Since we're struggling to keep the code working properly with the incognito feature muddying the logic everywhere, I propose removing that feature. In my opinion we should rethink its design after having evaluated whether the effort of maintaining this is really worth it.  These are my reasons for removal: - Allowing `userId` to mean two things leads to parallel logic in a lot of places. This leads to weird behaviour, see #328 for an example. - The haphazard design slows us down when extending critical functions such as removal of peer team members. - The additional code is difficult to understand yet critical from a privacy perspective. If we're promising privacy we should be certain that it works. - The harm done when users of this feature are exposed is bigger than if they didn't have this option in the first place. (They could've just created a second user to register incognito, we don't have a real-name-policy after all.) - The feature has few apparent benefits and is in a neglected state. - It's not being used.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/1099,196332168,Allow user to turn off WebRTC IP protection [was: WebRTC IP address hiding happens even when turned off],"It looks like Privacy Badger in Chrome is hiding my IP local IP address from WebRTC even when that setting is turned off.  Steps to test:  1. Turn on Privacy Badger in Chrome Incognito Mode. 2. Make sure the Privacy Badger ""Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP address"" box is unchecked. 3. Visit https://browserleaks.com/webrtc in an incognito window 4. Notice the local IP address does not show up. 5. Turn Privacy Badger in incognito mode off again. 6. Refresh the browserleaks page. 7. Notice that the local IP address is now visible.  This effect seems to occur whether or not Privacy Badger is enabled for the given site or not. If the ""Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP address"" box is checked, the browserleaks page can't even show the *public* IP address.  I think that something is badly wrong with Privacy Badger's interactions with WebRTC.

A few points of note: 1. Changing the setting to `default_public_interface_only` hides the local IP address. 2. Having this setting enabled doesn't in any way seem to effect the ability to use Google Hangouts, etc. (as per testing with Cooper) 3. In uBlock, the callback contains a call to check `chrome.runtime.lastError`, saying `lastError` needs to be checked or Chrome complains (see https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/875), but from my testing this doesn't seem to be an issue anymore. 4. There are 4 possible settings: `default`, `default_public_and_private_interfaces`, `default_public_interface_only` and `disable_non_proxied_udp`. I think that this last option might end up breaking some things, so the 3rd option seems safe. In case the user already has this fourth option selected, I've followed uBlock's approach and kept their setting as is.

The canvas element‚__s height and width properties must not be set below 16 px.10 2. Text must be written to canvas with least two colors or at least 10 distinct characters. 3. The script should not call the save, restore, or addEventListener methods of the rendering context. 4.

So what users type inside the site will be recorded, even though they don't submit that information. These per user recordings can be played back on hotjar.  Hotjar doesn't give information like IP addresses for those recordings, but if a user enter their personal details on that site, it will be recorded on those sessions.

It's giving me two options: 1) To permanently allow or 2) to permanently prohibit soundcloud from loading third party content.  GIven that I'm just trying to read someone's blog, I don't want to make such a hefty decision about the future of Soundcloud's 3rd party access right this moment.

Additionally, the [X] in the top right corner of the window doesn't do anything.

https://api.github.com/repos/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/314,53338728,Several usability issues for non-technical users,"I‚__m a German software developer, and I am evaluating whether I should recommend Privacy Badger to my family so that they can surf privately. The main requirement is that everything they see is understandable, written in German and that it works as expected. During the installation from scratch, I found multiple issues, which are grouped here together since they form a story. - When I search for ""privacy badger"" in the German Google, the first search hit is https://www.eff.org/de/node/73969. The ""de"" in the URL looks to me as if it means ""German version of node 73969"", but the page is in English. - The ""canonical"" of https://www.eff.org/de/node/73969 refers back to itself instead of the more human-friendly URL https://www.eff.org/privacybadger. - On the page https://www.eff.org/de/node/73969, when I click into the address bar of the browser and then press Tab, a tongue saying ""Skip to main content"" is displayed. When I click on that, ""#main-content"" appears in the address bar, but I‚__m still at the top of the page. - The text of the big green Install button is so pale that it looks like it were disabled, but it isn‚__t. - The page https://www.eff.org/node/73969 is in English, although my browser prefers German. - After installing the extension, the box ""Privacy Badger has been added to Chrome"" appears, but only for half a second. This may be because I visited the installer page in incognito mode. You probably cannot do anything about this, but I wanted to mention it, since it‚__s part of the story. - The firstRun.html page is in English, which my parents still don‚__t understand. - The page firstRun.html contains too much technical babble. It should be completely rewritten by someone who doesn‚__t know anything about the internet. The technical babble should still be made available, but only behind a ""technical details for experts"" link. - The page firstRun.html has quite long lines, so the line-height should be 135% to improve readability. - It‚__s not the extension that has three states, but each domain. - The text ""Privacy Badger"" in the main heading links to https://www.eff.org/ instead of a page that is specific to Privacy Badger. - When I start surfing, the Privacy Badger icon shows the number 17 on red background. This means to me that there are 17 ""red"" issues. But this is not the case. - So I hover the mouse over the icon, and the tooltip says only ""Privacy Badger"". No information about the 17, though. I had expected to get a summary like ""12 domains blocked, 3 cookies blocked, 2 domains ok"". - To get more details I click on the icon. Now I get a list of 17 green lines. This does not correspond to the number in the icon, which has a _red_ background. - The small question mark after ""These sliders let you control how privacy badger handles each tracker."" looks like a question mark, not like a help icon. It looks to me as if Privacy Badger were asking me something. - When I click the small question mark, I am led to the help page, to the specific answer. The question to that answer is not visible, but it should be, so I understand the context without having to scroll up.  Additionally, I have the following questions: - Does Privacy Badger respect the incognito mode and does not save anything to permanent storage in that mode? I cannot check this myself easily, since Privacy Badger doesn‚__t show me a list of blocked and cookie-blocked domains. - Privacy Badger always talks about blocking _domains_, but the UI suggests that it blocks only _hostnames_. Is that correct?  In summary, these are too many negative points, so I cannot yet recommend it to non-technical people. ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/243,38743316,"Privacy Badger changes some of my Chrome settings without telling me, and then locks me out of them","I installed Privacy Badger a few days ago and then began noticing that I was no longer getting search suggestions when typing in the address bar. I went into Chrome's settings to find both ""Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors"" and ""Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar or the app launcher search box"" turned off and grayed out so I couldn't turn them back on. I did a bit of research and found [this thread](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/NWtOOYtx4gg) on Google Product Forums pointing to Privacy Badger as the cause.  I realize that getting search suggestions involves sending what I type to the search engine, but I don't see this as a privacy issue; it's not going to any company I don't know about, and I'm going to send them the full search query anyway once I finish typing it. I would like to be able to use both search suggestions and PB's tracker blocking. For now, I will disable the extension. (I have a few others that do similar things.)

Solutions:  **(A)** HTML5 has a `noreferrer` option for links, but is is not widely supported. Move along.  **(B)** One option would be to disable the auto-links in etherpad. As far as I can tell, these can be disabled in ace2_inner.js `handleClick()` and pad_utils.js `escapeHtmlWithClickableLinks()`.   **(C)** Another option would be to change the way pad names are encoded in the URL to use the location hash instead of the path. For example, instead of `https://pad.riseup.net/p/0Jr0e` etherpad could use `https://pad.riseup.net/#0Jr0e`. The location hash (anchor) is not sent as part of the referrer.  **(D)** A final option is to create an interstitial page as part of etherpad. For example, every link would really go to `/redirect/`, where it would then get auto redirected on to the target website. The final target website could be sent to the request to `/redirect` either as a POST or in the location hash. For example, `/redirect#https%3A%2F%2Friseup.net%2Fwhat-is-my-referrer' would redirect to https://riseup.net/what-is-my-referrer.  Option D seems to me that it is probably the best for the moment: it would be easy to implement and it retains the usability of clickable links. On the downside, interstitial pages are slightly annoying because they make it a bit slower to get to the site you want.  Notes:  https -- If the pad is loaded via https, then the referrer is only sent to other https websites. This is small comfort, but important to know if you are trying this at home.   chrome -- Chrome is not able to figure out what the referrer should be of the inner ace iframe. I suspect this is because it is dynamically generated. The result is that if you click on a link in a pad body using chrome, no referrer is sent. Firefox has no such confusion, and links from the chat always send referrer in all browsers.  testing -- You can use https://riseup.net/what-is-my-referrer as a link to test if the referrer is being sent by the browser. Make sure to specify `https` and not `http` because the plain `http` link will redirect and erase the referrer. ",,

One idea is by using halftone raster that not only distorts the face but the whole image, but leaves on overall impression of the image intact.  The idea is to obfuscate image content (like persons, or at least the faces of persons) to decrease their recognition, by manipulating the whole image with raster/halftone.  The result may not be in a way that would be a perfect anonymisation, but it could hamper automatic recognition (to be proofed!). It may also focus the viewers perception on the setting/situation (e.g. a demonstration) and not so much on single acteurs in the scene.   Our approach would be to rasterize images automatically with a halftone raster. ImageMagick might be the way.   TODO:  - use a set of images and find matching parameters,  - document and discuss the results  What could be other approaches? - Prepare fotos appropriately with desktop tools (like Gimp), before uploading an image correlating information should be provided to sensiblize the user. - Using a client-side method to disguise a face, like with Opencv4nodejs  - Using a server-side method to diguise a face, e.g. with [ImageMagick and the mask feature](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47064408/blur-part-of-image-in-imagemagick)  Eitherway, image metadata shall be generally removed before they are uploaded into the backend.

Doing so irreversibly writes out log files specific to that event.  For certain use cases, this increases the availability of data for certain types of cross-VM persona/identity correlation, which would be available to attackers should a browser or application sandbox be breached.  ### The solution you'd like  As these dom0 requests do not require making any *changes* to the template, instead:  Before pulling the data, dom0 should invoke a temporary clone or disposable instance of the template in order to gather the same information for the settings/menus without modifying the downloaded template volumes.   Alternately, dom0 could start the template, but then rollback the changes to pre-snapshot  after shutdown (though this approach may be riskier).  ### The value to a user, and who that user might be  Some users, particular qubes-whonix users (but not only those), may want to utilize VM images that do not contain a history of usage beyond the publicly available build (that is, before the current local boot which is always the first local boot).

Users who need to submit tax forms.  ## What are they trying to achieve?  When submitting a tax form, the user wants their social security number (SSN) in the form to be kept private to protect against identity theft. Only the collective's admins should have access to the SSN.  In particular, the SSN should not be transmitted over email since doing so exposes the SSN to the user's email provider and potentially other third parties if the email provider does not require that incoming emails be encrypted in-transit.  The user may not trust their email provider or these other third-parties to protect the SSN. Even though a malicious entity in control of the user's email account could take over the user's OpenCollective account, that account takeover would not by itself give the entity access to the user's SSN, which is not available even from a logged-in account.  ## How are they currently doing this?  As far as I can tell, there is currently no way for users to prevent their completed forms from being sent to them over email. This means users have no way to avoid leaking their SSNs to their email providers.  ## What is the desired outcome of fixing this problem?  Ideally, users would be able to access their completed forms without leaking the contents of those forms to their email providers.

There are two facets I see to this: 1. We probably shouldn't provide an alternative flow for clicking on .pdf links if the user cancels the action 2.

For example, Google Season of Docs was very clear they did not want the Collective admin to have access to expense submitters' private info like payout details, address, tax status, because these details are mainly needed by the host admin and expose more private data, which is a risk.  On the other hand, OpenMined works closely with their payees and wants to understand what's going on when an expense is delayed, such as if we're waiting on their tax form or discussing an issue with their paypal account in the comments. They contact our support and we let them know what's going on, but it creates a barrier for them.  Maybe we could have more expense statuses to give further visibility without revealing private details? Like `awaiting tax form` or `pending account issue`? That seems overly complex though....",,

To kinda obfuscate traces it would be great if changes would be uploaded in batches (e.g. of 5) or in time intervals (e.g. every week).  It would also be great if there were some mechanism to pause uploading of edits. This can be useful when travelling, for example, so edits are published only when returned at home. The police advices to do the same for holiday pictures to avoid criminals being able to figure out when the house is 'unguarded'.

https://api.github.com/repos/openaustralia/planningalerts/issues/1505,869468916,Task based administrator tool,"This is a very high level issue for a potentially big new piece of work. Our current admin interface is a very simple CRUD based interface. It focuses on very simple changes to basic objects in the system (like Application, Comment, Report, Authority, etc..)  The idea with this issue is that we design a new interface that is focused on common tasks that an administrator has to do. These could be, for example, things like: * A user has asked to remove their name from a comment * A user has reported another user's comment * A user has reported that there is private information in the text of a development application  Each of these tasks is pretty involved to handle currently. It might involve looking in different systems and updating things in different places and sending several follow emails.   The intention of this new ""task based tool"" is not to automatically respond without any human involvement but rather to take the grunt work out of the myriad of tasks for the administrator so that they can spend more of their time being a helpful human to other humans and less time pushing buttons and figuring out and remembering how to do things.  As a first step I envisage that we would create a catalogue of common tasks and that the task based tool starts of being simple documentation to remind the administrator how to handle common situations. Over time this could then evolve into a more automated tool.  For instance, if a user has asked for their name to be removed from a comment for privacy reasons we might do the following: * Redact the comment (making it clear to anyone else looking that a redaction has taken place) * Email the user who made the comment (we might have some standard wording that can be updated by the administrator) * Email the updated comment to the council explaining that the user requested a change  None of these steps individually is particularly hard or difficult but when you have to do many of them as an administrator to handle a single user request it becomes tiresome and gets in the way of doing a good job for everyone involved. So, let's remove the drudge work by making each step a little easier and more seamless.",,

This resolves this issue by properly applying the StateYourBusiness authorization filter to the Controller rather than the Service Accounts class, and updating the appropriate filter to check if a user is FacStaff, Police, or a Group Admin. The latter is necessary for managing memberships (see lines 176-185 of `views/ActivityProfile/components/Membership/index.js` (line numbers subject to change) where a Group Admin needs a user's ID to add a membership. In best practice, this should probably be changed to only require Gordon emails for memberships and keep account IDs in the back end, or some other method. However, for now we will simply restrict access to only these administrative roles which will greatly improve security.  Resolves #345",,

The [message](https://pastebin.com/raw/ptFQityt) was:  - _Using coin control_ - _Custom change address_  _When one clicks the increase transaction fee button, it adds another input rather than increasing the fee by reducing the change output. Major privacy leak since you have no control of the input used._  From that it sounds like the observed behavior is that the replacement transaction includes an additional UTXO that was not chosen by the user, even though the transaction was composed as a Coin Control transaction.  So I'm assuming the expected behavior would be for Bitcoin Core to remember that this OUTPUT was actually a Custom Change Address and to then lower the amount of that OUTPUT by the amount needed for the fee bump.  And, now that I am thinking of this, isn't there the expectation that if my initial transaction was done using Coin Control, and then if my fee bump (RBF) needs another UTXO input to cover the increase in fee, that Coin Selection for that will occur (regardless of whether or not the change address was a Custom Change Address)?

This includes all associated activity, messaging tokens, particularly any health related data. This will likely rely on GCP guarantees of expunging all data within six months of deletion. The availability and guarantees on data deletion should be visible within the UI and also the privacy policy. Aggregated and anonymized may persist beyond that. The delete option should also prompt the user to change various other privacy controls (e.g. Analytics) if that is what they desire.  ## Desired Solution  Firebase has a ""delete-user-data"" tool that's keyed off the `userId`.

https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/strategy/issues/241,742299847,W3C Workshop on Smart Cities,"Based on the [discussion during the TPAC breakout on Smart Cities](https://www.w3.org/2020/10/29-smart-cities-minutes.html), I've generated an initial proposal for the expected W3C Workshop on Smart Cities as follows.  And also updated the descriptions based on the [Template of the workshop Proposal](https://www.w3.org/Project/Workshop.html#Prepare) (Team-only).  Now a [draft Call-for-Participation page](https://w3c.github.io/smartcities-workshop/) is also available.  ## Topic and rationale of workshop  ### General background  These days Smart Cities topic is getting more and more popular and there are expectations for smarter and easier integration of various technologies from multiple vendors related to IoT devices and Web services specifically with the current COVID-19 situation.  On the other hand, [use cases on Smart Cities](https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/#smart-city) have been discussed within the Web of Thing (WoT) IG as part of the WoT standardizaton based on the [proposal during the Second WoT Workshop in Munich](https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/minutes.html#day2-item02).  However, Smart Cities topic include various technologies and WoT is just one of those technologies. Therefore we would like to create a dedicated W3C Interest Group: * to identify and document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services, * to obtain feedback from all stakeholders on the usage of Web technologies for Smart Cities, * to gather expert input on important features for Smart Cities based on the Web technology, and * to provide a forum for technical and business discussions related to Smart Cities.  We've already generated an [initial draft Charter for the expected Smart Cities Interest Group](http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html). However, we still need to identify actual stakeholders of the Smart Cities technology and collect even more use cases along with concrete system implementation experiences from all over the world, because Smart Cities topic depends on the cities' locations, cultures, etc., and include various sub-systems from many different vendors.  Therefore we'd like to hold a dedicated W3C workshop on the possible standardization for Smart Cities.  ### Goals  The Web has become a platform for various industries and services including payments and commerce, publishing, media distribution, video conferencing and connected cars, and it's becoming a promising platform for IoT interoperability as mentioned in the [Web of Things Press Release in April 2020](https://www.w3.org/2020/04/pressrelease-wot-rec.html.en). Also there is an expectation for the Web of Things standards to be applied to integration of huge numbers of sub-systems for Smart City services.  Therefore we've been generating a [draft Charter for the expected Smart Cities Interest Group](http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html) to (1) introduce the W3C as a place to have discussions on interoperability for Smart City services and (2) document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services.  Now we would like to improve the description of the [draft Charter](http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html) by holding a dedicated W3C workshop to see what can be done with the existing Web standards and what is still missing that would help people to implement Smart Cities.  The goals of the workshop should include:  * Identify the stakeholders of Smart Cities standardization to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities  * Clarify reasonable applications for Smart Cities we agree to build and what privacy and security protections we must include in the base environment to support those applications  * and then see how to improve the [draft Charter for the expected Smart Cities Interest Group](http://w3c.github.io/wot/charters/smart-cities/smart-cities-ig-charter.html) for further discussions within the expected IG  ### Possible topics  * Summary of the current status of Smart Cities   * What we already have   * Common issues on the interoperability among products from multiple vendors   * Missing features with the existing mechanisms  * Needs for Web-based Smart Cities of the stakeholders including the users,  the developers and the governments:   * Smarter and easier integration   * Improving/extending the existing services   * Applying the advanced technologies like robotics, speech processing, AI, etc., to the Smart Cities use cases   * Necessary metadata to handle information on humans, devices, location, environment, etc.  * Common technologies for integration of multiple sub-systems:   * Trust of the data   * Discovery of resources   * High-speed network environment for realtime interaction   * Semantics and syntax definition by taxonomy and ontology  In addition to the technical topics like the above, the following topics are tightly related to Smart City services in general and very important not only from the viewpoint of IoT technologies but also the viewpoint of Smart City as the city-wide service infrastructure, e.g., free broadband connection everywhere:   * Security and privacy   * Accessibility and usability   * Internationalization and compatibility with region-specific issues  Therefore those topics should be discussed for all the sessions during the workshop to incorporate design-for-all thinking throughout all aspects of the Smart City infrastructure, e.g., to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities in every activity and at every stage of life and to resolve internationalization issues including both technical ones and legal/policy ones.  Specifically, ""Privacy for Smart Cities"" should be a dedicated topic of the workshop to discuss the potential challenges on the question of ""Can the Smart Cities operate in manner that respects end users and citizens?"". For that purpose, we would like to get participants in the workshop from not only technologies but also legal and civil society participants.  ### Example of possible use cases  The possible use cases for Smart Cities should include integration of many devices and sub-systems developed by different vendors, and also should be considered from various stakeholders' viewpoints.  Some examples are listed below:  Use cases within a smart city: * Healthcare * Transportation and connected cars * Traffic management * Public venues (indoor and out) * E-learning and educational institutions * Life in tough situation and/or emergency  Use cases on related to multiple smart cities: * Data exchange between different smart cities * Multi-language support * Universal ID to identify the users and their information  Use Cases in the surrounding areas of a smart city: * Smart agriculture * Urbanization of rural areas * Life monitoring  ## Proposed dates and location  This would be a remote workshop. No physical location.  Aiming at the end of June 2021.  ## Host  none  ## Organizing Committee  * Michael McCool, Intel * Sebastian Kaebisch, Siemens * Carl Ward, Amazon * Daihei Shiohama, MediaDo * Tomoaki Mizushima, IRI * Yun Li, Tencent * Andrea Cimmino, UPM * Cristiano Aguzzi, Unibo * Linda van den Brink, Geonovum * Takuji Kiura, W3C Agriculture CG Chair * Farshid Tavakolizadeh, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft * Philip Tran, Singapore Government Technology Agency * Kaz Ashimura, W3C  ## Profile of attendees  Various stakeholders of Smart Cities including: * Government agents * Service providers * System implementers * Web browser vendors * Retail sellers * Transport business * Users from various countries/communities * Legal and civil society experts * Other SDOs working on IoT and Smart Cities  ## Expected number of attendees  Unclear, but no physical room limits. Speakers, up to 10 per session. Perhaps 20 to 50 attendees for the discussion, plus the speakers for that session. Some people might attend only one of the sessions.  ## Budget  Zero for travel, room hire, refreshments; virtual workshop.  Depending on the discussion by the Program Committee, there is a possibility of providing captions of prerecorded videos, up to 10 per session, 10 minutes per talk.  Possible estimation of the cost (e.g., with 3 sessions; 300 minutes at max; around USD1.25 per minute = USD375) is:  Captioning of discussion sessions, 3 hours per session = 9 hours at USD477 for three hours = USD 1,431  [Transcription services](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript_services.html)  ## Horizontal review  done with the pending accessibility conversation and a possible additional loop on security  ## Sponsors  None yet. Will seek sponsorship for cost reduction for the possible captioning service, but request W3M commit to the captioning costs to allow the workshop to move forward.  ## Workplan * 8 March 2021: initial Organizing Committee formed * 17 March 2021: get W3M approval for holding the workshop [16 March 2021 Strategy minutes](https://www.w3.org/2021/03/16-strat-minutes.html) * 26 March 2021: publish the Workshop pages including the Call-for-Participation page * 30 April 2021: deadline for the paper/statement submission * 25 June 2021: Workshop (virtual) ",,
https://api.github.com/repos/quicwg/qlog/issues/119,733724164,Make initiator clear in connection_started,"Currently, `connection_started` utilizes `src_ip` and `dst_ip` (and equivalent for ports), where the intended meaning is that src means the initiator (typically client) and dst the server.   However, this is a) unclear and b) it does not allow deducing what the ""local"" ip is for where this trace was captured without correlating client/server with the vantagepoint (and if that vantagepoint is network, it becomes more murky).   Some options for solving: 1. rename fields to `local_ip` and `remote_ip`   2. add `initiator` field (e.g., with values 'local' and 'peer') 3. completely revise how we log paths/IPs and potentially decouple from `connection_started` (also good in terms of privacy, migration, multipath, ...).   Option 3 is probably best, should revisit when properly fixing migration in qlog (see also #79 and #57)  cc @marten-seemann  ",,

It uses a self made data set of different celebrities to audit different facial processing technologies (FPT). Some key points include: - providing data on how FPT works with different attributes (i.e. binary gender, age ) - providing data on how FPT works with different types of people (skin color, binary gender) - provides examples on ethical concerns such as racial bias and privacy loss I thought this article was very informative and useful. It provides specific data to highlight key points, and also cites useful examples to other articles that could help.   ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/910,686228124,Add per-buffer data storage,"This moves all the storage-related data to buffers and makes for a flexible per-buffer storage settings.  ### Motivation It's necessary to separate some data (e.g., cookies, local-storage) for different buffers to preserve users privacy, when necessary. Nyxt had no such mechanism, except for rebinding browser-based `(history|download|bookmarks)-path` slots, which is awkward. Another alternative, the `data-profile`s, was good for disabling all the storage, but was inflexible and uncomfortable to work with (however, it just can be my subjective repulsion from signatures like `(defmethod expand-data-path ((profile (eql +default-data-profile+)) (path session-data-path))...)` — it just doesn't look right).  This patch aims to make it easier to customize storage settings and isolate them for certain buffers. This opens the way for per-domain data storage settings and private mode (outlined below in ""What's Not There (Yet)"") and, possibly, some other conveniences I can't even imagine yet!  ### What's New - `data-profile` is now the place for some data-storing slots:   - `downloads`,   - `download-watcher`,   - `history-data`,   - `bookmarks-data`,   - `auto-mode-rules` - `buffer` is the home for previously `browser`-based slots:   - `download-path`,   - `history-path`,   - `bookmarks-path`,   - `session-path`,   - `auto-mode-rules-path`,   - `cookies-path`,   - `standard-output-path`,   - `error-output-path`. - `buffer`s now have a `data-profile` slot, so storage can be adjusted on a per-buffer basis. - `restore` and `store` generic functions to (re)store the data from the given paths, depending on the paths themselves. - `expand-path` and, consequently, `with-data-file` now require additional buffer argument. Several functions/commands changed their signatures to match this change. - `default-data-profile` and `private-data-profile` classes with (respectively) class-allocated data and instance-allocated data. In other words: now all the data of the buffers with default profiles will be shared, while buffers with private profile will be isolated even from each other. - `*global-data-profile` comes as an alternative to the `+default-data-profile+`, because the latter had two use cases:   - providing default data-management behavior;   - dispatching the path on browser-less paths (e.g., `*init-file-path*`);   While the first goal is now covered by `default-data-profile` class, the second needs some handling, and global variable seems to be necessary here, as something neither `browser`- nor `buffer`-based. - data-storage.lisp is now less dependent on other files and it's easier to extract to a separate library. Some work still needs to be done though. - Manual and documentation are adjusted to the changes. - Some typo and syntax fixes.  ### What's Not There (Yet) - The per-buffer `data-profile`-conscious `*Downloads*` buffer is not there yet, because it's better to implement it together with #909. - Ephemeral/private/nodata buffers (#247) -- these can be built on top of `private-data-profile`, path redefinition, and `is-ephemeral` `WebKitWebView` property, but this is somewhat out of scope of this patch. - Per-domain cookies (and whatever else) isolation (#837) -- this can be implemented with introduction of several `isolate-(downloads|history|bookmarks|cookies)-mode` modes that will alter the buffer-local `data-profile` (introduce `isolate-cookies-data-profile`?) and with `auto-mode` to toggle them. Doesn't seem hard, but it's outside the scope of this pull request too.  I've assigned to implement the latter two, but I won't be able to do this properly, so this pull request is my best shot at making #247 and #837 implementable.  ### Caveats - The look of data-concerned (`buffer`, `data-profile`) class definition asks for new `defclass` (#889) — the number and similarity of slots is horrible xD - It's currently hard to know what profile is used by the browser at browser startup. Inspecting the `buffer` class with the help of MOP seems to be the only solid option, but it's not perfect either. - Race conditions can happen on file access and we don't have any safety mechanism against it yet.  ### Possible Future Directions - `:read-only`/`:readonly` storage keyword. It can be useful for obvious reasons of reading what's stored on disk without persisting the changes. However, it would require non-obvious changes and, possibly, even more strict storage policy. - Ability to store data in browser instance to duplicate less data (although it's solved by `*global-data-profile*` already)? - Lock file access while `restore`-ing and `store`-ing data separately? - Maybe making alias methods for data-storing slots specialized on buffers (`bookmarks-data` and friends), so that `(bookmarks-data buffer) = (bookmarks-data (data-profile buffer))`? I think it's faulty to use such aliases, but it looks prettier and somewhat more intuitive (alternative: actually move data-storing slots to `buffer`, instead of creating aliases -- not really useful though). - Make the storage safe from race conditions. I've sketched it, but it needs more thought and redesign. Here's the macro I came up with and that should be used to wrap the bodies of the data-altering functions (and it's a pattern you can see in the current code of the functions referred to in the docstring). Importantly, it's unclear where should we store locks and what operations should be blocking. ``` lisp (export-always 'with-parallel-data-access) (defmacro with-parallel-data-access (path buffer &body body)   ""Macro to conveniently access persisted data in the data-altering functions.

Bookmarks were isolated and saved to a dedicated file!   I've also ran Nyxt for some time to test whether the changes could have broken anything. Doesn't seem like so.  Additional testing is welcome though, because I may not notice some bugs due to my Nyxt use-style.  I'll be glad to know what you think of it! ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4476,659924746,tls: Add ability to encrypt TLS key on disk,"Currently LND writes the TLS private key to disk in plaintext. If you are running in an untrusted environment this could be a problem as someone could use the key to snoop on your API traffic and steal credentials. This pull request creates a way to encrypt the TLS key on disk so even if your server is compromised or others have access, they can't spy on your traffic.  In these changes, we add a new flag to `lnd` called `--tlsencryptkey`. When this is enabled, `lnd` encrypts the TLS key using the wallet's seed and writes the encrypted blob to disk. Because the key is encrypted to the wallet's seed, that means we can only use the TLS pair when the wallet is unlocked. This would leave the `WalletUnlocker` service without TLS. To fix this problem, we create a temporary TLS pair specifically for the `WalletUnlocker` RPC. This temporary TLS key is only stored in memory and the temporary TLS cert is written to disk at the same path as `tlscertpath`, but with `.tmp` appended to the end of the filename. After unlocking, `lnd` deletes the cert from disk and clears the private key from memory. Then uses the main TLS certificate for all other RPCs.  Of course, this changes the flow of unlocking/init a little bit. If you use `--tlsencryptkey` on `lnd`, then you'll need a way to access the temporary TLS cert for verification. The simplest way to do this is to use `lncli` on the same host `lnd` is running on and point `--tlscertpath` at the temporary cert. If that's not possible then the user will need to come up with a way to copy the temporary certificate out of the `lnd` server and get it to their client device.   _Summary of Changes:_  - Moves the crypto.go file from chanbackup into its own package called lnencrypt. This was needed because we can't directly reference the encryptPayloadToWriter and decryptPayloadFromReader functions from the chanbackup package due to circular dependency issues. Also, I think it's very likely that future enhancements will also want to use these same functions. Thus I've moved them to their own package. (cherry-picked from #4458)  - Creates a new flag (`--tlsencryptkey`) that tells `lnd` to encrypt the TLS private key on disk. If set, it will generate temporary TLS certs for the `WalletUnlocker` RPC. Allows users to prevent spying on API traffic in untrusted environments.  - Add necessary tests and documentation   ",,

Type below this line. --> R4.0     <!-- Type above this line. --> ### Affected component(s) or functionality:<!-- Type below this line. -->  If an inter-VM RPC policy is set to ""ask by default"", a program running in one VM can exploit this to determine the names of other VMs that exist on the system.    <!-- Type above this line. --> --- <!---------------------------> ### Steps to reproduce the behavior:<!-- Use single backticks (`) for in-line code snippets and triple backticks (```) for code blocks. Type below this line. -->  If I have a VM called ""personal"" (installed, not necessarily running), and a program running in the VM ""untrusted"" issues the command ""qvm-open-in-vm personal foo.txt"", then Qubes will display a dialog box asking me to confirm the action.  However, if I *don't* have a VM called ""personal"", then the command ""qvm-open-in-vm personal foo.txt"" will immediately fail without opening a dialog.    <!-- Type above this line. --> ### Expected or desired behavior:<!-- Type below this line. -->  By default, software running in one VM shouldn't be able to detect the existence of another VM.  So unless there's a specific policy to allow or deny calls from ""untrusted"" to ""personal"", the qvm-open-in-vm command should behave the same way regardless of whether ""personal"" actually exists or not.     <!-- Type above this line. --> ### Actual behavior:<!-- Type below this line. -->  If an attacker is able to guess that I am running Qubes and using the default configuration, and if they could exploit a bug in some program running in the ""untrusted"" VM, they could easily determine whether or not I have a VM called ""personal"" - because if I don't, then the RPC request will fail within a fraction of a second.     <!-- Type above this line. --> ### General notes:<!-- Type below this line. -->  This applies to many of the default RPC policies, not only qubes.OpenInVM.  One solution would be, if the policy is set to ""ask"", there should be a prompt *even if the specified target VM does not exist*.

https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin-global/bitcoin-global/issues/11,655379662,Segwit integration,**Description** SegWit is implemented in Bitcoin Global.  **Additional context** Activated segregated witness (segwit) allows transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction signatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is covered by the txid.  **Related to** This provides several immediate benefits: _Elimination of unwanted transaction malleability _Capacity increase _Weighting data based on how it affects node performance _Signature covers value _Linear scaling of sighash operations _Increased security for multisig _More efficient almost-full-node security _Script versioning  **Sources** https://github.com/bitcoin-global/bitcoin-global/blob/master/README.md ,,
https://api.github.com/repos/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/837,653797954,Cookies isolation (e.g. per-domain),"Cookies have been the bane of privacy for long, so Nyxt gotta do something about it! :)  A nice feature would be to isolate cookie per-domain. Currently, Nyxt can set the cookies path.  Changing it for a live buffer might not be very useful because I don't think it changes in-memory cookies (this would need verification).  So we need to see if WebKitGTK has some options to isolate cookies within a live buffer. If not, we might have to create a new buffer when navigating to a domain for which we want isolated cookies. This is similar to how we need to do ""private / incognito"" buffers (#247).",,

https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/issues/132,649980745,[For Discussion] Current key upload validation does not prevent mass upload of keys for a single day period.,"In going through discussions with various legal/policy folks, I opined that there may be some loopholes in our upload path that were open given our preference to prioritize privacy.  One that seems to have come up is the ability to upload 28 keys for a single RSIN (day) period.   There is currently a check for overlapping / dupe RSIN's https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-server/blob/ba42406661a651050e8e85aae36d4ddd4a0ba8f7/pkg/server/upload.go#L258 however, it is trivially bypassed by uploading keys one at a time, as we do not have any method to track other than 'remainingKeys'.  Initial idea is to create a simple upload/rsin map, something along the lines of ""100100111100.."" representing upload on day 1, 4, 7,8,9, 10 .... This in *theory* does not break the privacy guarantees of having the diagnosis keys unassociated with a single entity in the encryption keys table, but it potentially does reduce it, so we'll hold on any implementation until we understand and can weigh the two attack vectors accordingly.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4421,646424033,tls: add --tlsdisableautofill flag to prevent sensitive data leaks,"This PR adds a boolean flag to disable the certificate generation process from using the network interface IP addresses and the system hostname. This is designed to prevent unintended private IP and hostname leaks. Also when this flag is set along with the `--tlsextradomain` flag, LND will set the extra domain as the Comman Name for the certificate.  There are several situations where a user would not want the interface IP addresses added as SANs to their TLS Certificates. For example, if someone was running their LND node behind a load balancer. If LND uses their network interface IPs then it would likely expose the private IP address of the node which should be kept secret. The user could leverage the existing --tlsextraip flag to add in the load balancer's IP address instead.

Private transaction distributed to all participants.     3. Privacy marker transaction created and submitted to transaction pool with nonce of 0 if using one time accounts.         If using a specific account (specified using --privacy-marker-transaction-signing-key-file), the nonce for that account is obtained and used for the privacy marker transaction.    4. Privacy marker transaction mined and included in block.   5. When block containing privacy marker transaction is imported and privacy marker transaction processed, the private transaction is retrieved from Orion and executed. The nonce is validated as correct at this point.   b. Private transaction with incorrect nonce:     1. Submit private transaction with nonce 2 (it's the 4th transaction in the privacy group from this account)     2. Private transaction distributed to all participants.     3. Privacy marker transaction created and submitted to transaction pool with nonce of 0 if using one time accounts.         If using a specific account (specified using --privacy-marker-transaction-signing-key-file), the nonce for that account is obtained and used for the privacy marker transaction.    4. Privacy marker transaction mined and included in block.   5. When block containing privacy marker transaction is imported and privacy marker transaction processed, the private transaction is retrieved from Orion and executed. The private transaction execution will fail because the private transaction nonce is incorrect. ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues/6896,631405425,Improve Doc - Add to endpoint which can handle interception," Is it possible to add to the document which end-points can handle SSL interception? For security reasons, proxy servers perform SSL interception to ensure no malicious things are in the https/ssl package. Endpoints which can't handle this, and service fail because of this, need to be excluded from this kind of interception.  If this kind of info would be available, it would make life easier for the security admin who is managing the proxy settings. It would also ensure such security measures will not break Microsoft Services crucial for the good working of the OS.   --- #### Document Details  _ *Do not edit this section.

https://api.github.com/repos/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4271,615409523,TLS certificate SAN entries (e.g. for IPv6) - privacy implications,"### Background  The [automatic generation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/cert/selfsigned.go#L188) of the self-signed certificate that is used to ensure the encryption of data from and to the gRPC and REST interface contains several entries in the `Subject Alternative Name` field. Some of these make no sense and some might be considered **sensitive** in some scenarios.  Here is an example of a newly created certificate on v0.9.2-beta:  X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:  * 1 DNS:raspiblitz  <- the system host name -> the user can set this to some either unique or non-unique value.. so I guess it's fine * 2 DNS:localhost   -> fine * 3 DNS:myalias.dyndns.org    <- setup and configured by me through `tlsextradomain` -> fine * 4 DNS:unix    -> fine - I guess * 5 DNS:unixpacket -> fine - I guess * 6 DNS:bufconn  -> fine - I guess * 7 IP Address:127.0.0.1  -> fine * 8 IP Address:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 <- does this match ""[::1]""? - I would assume so -> fine * 9 IP Address:192.168.178.20 -> mostly ok, I guess * 10 IP Address:2001:16B8:<redacted>:CA0 -> very likely problematic * 11 IP Address:2001:16B8:<redacted>:6F99 -> potential problems * 12 IP Address:FE80:0:0:0:C<redacted>CA0 -> very likely problematic  I have a problem with 10 and 12. On my Raspberry Pi the link local FE80 address is currently the same as it was before doing a complete reinstall. And the unique part is even reflected/copied to the globally scoped `2001:..` (10) IP.  If I expose gRPC/REST to the internet (either on clearnet or on TOR) then this could be used to fingerprint/identify my system - even after a reset of the LND public keys.  The least would be to include this in the operators guide.  But actually I don't think many people use the link local IPv6 to connect to their LND node from another device on the LAN. I would suggest to only include the IPv6 for localhost (::1) by default and leave out the other addresses. Users that need additional IPv6 IPs in the SAN field can add those with `tlsextraip`.   I am aware that I can simply generate my own private key and certificate and provide it to LND. But I believe that LND should provide safe, secure and privacy friendly defaults.  ### Your environment  * version of `lnd`: `v0.9.2-beta` * which operating system (`uname -a` on *Nix): `Linux raspiblitz 4.19.97-v7+ #1294 SMP Thu Jan 30 13:15:58 GMT 2020 armv7l GNU/Linux`  ### Steps to reproduce  Run command: `$ openssl x509 -in ~/.lnd/tls.cert -noout -text | grep -A 1 ""Subject Alternative Name""`.  ### Expected behaviour  Don't have anything show up that will be persistent even after a clean reinstall (on same hardware, on same LAN).  ### Actual behaviour  The link local IPv6 address (which is generated - I believe - based on information on the system and the local network) is included.

https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18861,611656010,Do not answer GETDATA for to-be-announced tx,"This PR intends to improve transaction-origin privacy.  In general, we should try to not leak information about what transactions we have (recently) learned about before deciding to announce them to our peers. There is a controlled transaction dissemination process that reveals our transactions to peers that has various safeguards for privacy (it's rate-limited, delayed & batched, deterministically sorted, ...), and ideally there is no way to test which transactions we have before that controlled process reveals them. The handling of the `mempool` BIP35 message has protections in this regard as well, as it would be an obvious way to bypass these protections (handled asynchronously after a delay, also deterministically sorted).  However, currently, if we receive a GETDATA for a transaction that we have not yet announced to the requester, we will still respond to it if it was announced to *some* other peer already (because it needs to be in `mapRelay`, which only happens on the first announcement). This is a slight privacy leak.  Thankfully, this seems easy to solve: `setInventontoryTxToSend` keeps track of the txids we have yet to announce to a peer - which almost(*) exactly corresponds to the transactions we know of that we haven't revealed to that peer. By checking whether a txid is in that set before responding to a GETDATA, we can filter these out.  (*) Locally resubmitted or rebroadcasted transactions may end up in setInventoryTxToSend while the peer already knows we have them, which could result in us incorrectly claiming we don't have such transactions if coincidentally requested right after we schedule reannouncing them, but before they're actually INVed. This is made even harder by the fact that filterInventoryKnown will generally keep known reannouncements out of setInventoryTxToSend unless it overflows (which needs 50000 INVs in either direction before it happens).  The condition for responding now becomes:  ```   (not in setInventoryTxToSend) AND   (     (in relay map) OR     (       (in mempool) AND       (old enough that it could have expired from relay map) AND       (older than our last getmempool response)     )   ) ```",,

The original DCI spec was not vulnerable to rouge key attacks but breaks a key privacy guarantee (see https://github.com/mit-dci/dlcspec/issues/5). To their credit, the authors of this spec seem to have understood that and has mitigated the issue to some extent, but not completely.  Each party has its own contract execution transaction that it can broadcast upon the completion of any event. If both parties broadcast such a transaction (which presumably is what is meant to happen?) then any observer of both transactions can identify the `Oracle Signature Point`.  This is what the CET looks like in the spec atm:  ``` OP_IF   <Oracle Signature Point + Local Funding Public Key + SHA256(Local Sweep Public Key)*G> OP_ELSE   <Timeout> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP   <Remote Sweep Public Key> OP_ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG ``` Any observer who sees both contract execution transactions will be able to determine what the `Oracle Signature Point ` is seeing as they can figure out `Local Sweep Public Key` from the other transaction and they know ` Local Funding Public Key` from the funding output.  My recommendation is to use a completely unrelated key to add to the `Oracle Signature Point` in the CET and provide a proof of knowledge on it (a Schnorr signature under it suffices).  ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/strategy/issues/221,595841694,Proposal: Workshop on User-friendly Smart Agents on the Web - Voice interaction and what's next?,"## General background  * Thanks to the advancement of HTML5 and related Web technologies, Web applications with speech capability is getting more and more popular for ease of user-interaction and richer user experience such as Apple's SIRI, Google's Voice Assistant and Amazon's Alexa.  * Thus voice agents are one of the essential applications on various devices especially mobile phones, tablet devices, eBook readers, and gaming platforms. In addition, traditional platforms such as TV's, audio systems and automobiles are rapidly becoming capable of speech interaction.  * Also these days smart speakers are getting a portal for IoT services including smart homes.  * On the other hand, during [one of the breakout sessions at TPAC 2019 in Fukuoka](https://www.w3.org/2019/09/18-voice-minutes.html), there was discussion about potential needs for improved voice agents for web services.  ## Focus  * See the current status of the voice-enabled smart platforms integrating multi-vendor services/applications/devices:   * Interaction with smart devices   * Control from Web browsers   * Interoperability and access to controls for accessibility/usability, e.g., smart navigation  * And discuss what is missing for the voice interaction technology to be deployed globally for all the languages throughout the world   ## Possible topics  * Summary of the current status:   * What we already have in the browsers   * Common issues on the interoperability among the browsers/platforms   * Missing features with the existing APIs  * Needs of the users and the developers:   * Smarter interaction for easier use, e.g.:     * Short and clear commands using mixed input including voice and the other modalities (and possible mechanism to define the command sets)     * Smarter dialog model between human and the system     * Adjusting the system behavior based on the user's responses   * Improved pronunciation for speech synthesis in various languages. See also the [APA WG's video for TPAC 2020](https://www.w3.org/2020/10/TPAC/apa-pronunciation.html).   * Applying the advanced voice technology for Web services (Speech style, Expression, Feeling, Emotion, etc.)   * Dealing with both the input entities (sensors/applications) and output entities (actuators/devices/digital twins) from various vendors   * Presentation issues such as how/what/when to transfer necessary information from the input entities (possibly the users, devices or applications) and present it to the output entities (also possibly the users, devices or applications)   * Integration of multiple interchangeable modalities (typing, handwriting, voice, etc.)  * Underlying technologies:   * Smarter dialog management model for integrating multiple applications   * Applications/services/devices from different multiple vendors   * Unified data format and protocols for data transfer   * State transition management model and service lifecycle   * Natural language processing technology and resources for that, e.g., phonetic databases, parallel corpola   * Possible improved model and architecture for voice interaction and expected technologies (also the relationship between those technologies and the Web technology)  * Horizontal platform:   * Discovery of resources   * Privacy and security   * Accessibility and usability   * Internationalization and compatibility with region-specific technology  ## Example of related use cases  Related technology area is broad including: * Voice agent * Connected car * Smart homes/Smart factories/Smart cities * Smart speakers/Smartphones as a portal/user device * IoT services in general  For example, Hybrid TV services (Web+TV integration based on HTML5, Second Screen, TTML, etc.) and smart home devices and services. Possibly additional proprietary technology like MiniApps, e.g.: * Asking the voice agent ""I want to order takeaway."" on the TV in the living room to order a pizza. * Choosing the food using voice commands and saying ""checkout"" to the smart watch would process the payment.  Another example is in searching for television content. The user asks ""Play [name of an episodic TV show]"" and the voice assistant will speak ""Here's what I found"" while displaying search results on the TV. A useful user requirement may be the ability to request congruent user feedback (ie if voice is used for input then speech is used for feedback).  '''NOTE:''' The above is just a few example of the possible use cases, and your own use cases are welcome and really appreciated :)  ## Who to attend?  * Many possible stakeholders including:   * Service providers/System implementers   * Govt (like Singapore)   * Users from various countries/communities  * Liaisons   * CHIP (Amazon, Apple, Google and Zigbee)   * OCF   * oneM2M   * Singapore Govtech ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/vector-im/element-ios/issues/2731,496455500,Send validation tokens to submit_url from HS,"Cloned from https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10923  As part of [MSC2078](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2078), `requestToken` calls to the HS ([during registration](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/unstable#post-matrix-client-r0-register-msisdn-requesttoken), [add to HS account](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/unstable#post-matrix-client-r0-account-3pid-msisdn-requesttoken), [password reset](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/unstable#post-matrix-client-r0-register-msisdn-requesttoken)) _may_ return a `submit_url` field which should be used if present as the place to send validation tokens.  Per spec this could happen for both email and MSISDNs, but at this stage Synapse only intends to use it with MSISDNs.  If `submit_url` is present, clients should ask the user for the validation token and submit it to the supplied URL, structuring parameters in the same way as the IS `POST /validate/email/submitToken` API. (You should assume it's a v1-style endpoint without authentication.)  Synapse work tracked in https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6076.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/mlswg/mls-protocol/issues/208,494074166,Add authenticated_data to the mls message.,"[As previously discussed](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/jB5ygAJs3P8TLkduj6Q9vFWmSJI), this is a proposal to add AAD to the application messages.  There are many motivations to do this: _ It's a 'cheap' feature to add (although it could potentially be misused) _ It avoids duplicate content: if there is a content that needs to be authenticated, but also needs to be visible to the server, the only solution today is to repeat it in the header (to the server) and then in the encrypted body. _ Modern ciphers already provide support for AAD, and MLS takes advantage of this. In fact most(all?) of the fields in the header are authenticated already. _ This field is optional(as in: can be empty), which means that it doesn't have to be used in the implementation.  The primary benefit is for the server to have access to the fields that are otherwise authenticated, but are not part of MLS message. Typically, the server has another encryption mechanism with the client (e.g. TLS) and as such client-server communication is already secure. As a matter of fact, handshake messages can already be transported in plaintext (in case server needs to examine their content), but application messages are not allowed to have any plaintext content, even though server may need to examine some metadata as well.  A couple of thoughts that may be worth discussing:  * what should be the max size of authenticated_data (I assumed 32KB, just like application message) * whether *authenticated data* should be offered only as part of *application*, or both *handshake message* and *application message*. It is fair to consider it only for an *application message*, though for simplicity I added it to both message types. Happy to change it based on general preferences.",,

Since it's now possible to be disconnected from an identity server entirely (your session has no active identity server), it's unclear how features that require an IS to function should behave.  For the case of the Discovery section in Settings, it's easy enough: you have no IS, so we don't show any 3PIDs to control.  However, there are other IS-using features in Riot, like:  1.

https://api.github.com/repos/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4972,432670281,Reduce leakage of disposable VM content and history into dom0 filesystem,"**The problem you're addressing (if any)** Considerable information about the history of disposable VM usage, as well as some contents of data from inside disposable VM leaks into the filesystem of dom0 and in most cases, survives reboots.  In particular, the leakage into the xfwm4-*.state files (and lack of cleanup) is particular disturbing.  e.g. in dom0 rm disp_files.txt # if exists rm disp_contents.txt # if exists sudo grep -rn '/' -e 'disp[0-9]' --exclude-dir={dev,proc,sys} | sort > disp_contents.txt sudo find / -name \*disp[0-9]\* | sort > disp_files.txt # matches references to disposable VM names in filenames  Some findings on files related to disposable VMs (via disp_files.txt): 1. snapshots/volatile volumes for disposable VMs that were not shutdown correctly in the past (found in /dev/qubes_dom0/ and /dev/mapper/ ) 2. xml config files for the same in /etc/libvirt/libxl/ and /run/libvirt/libxl/ 3. appmenus for the same in /home/admin/.local/share/ 4. qrexec files for the same in /run/qubes/ 5. qubes.db pid and sock files for the same in /run/qubes/ 6. linux mapper links for the same in /run/udev/links/{\x2fmapper,\x2fqubes_dom0}/ 7. directories for the above in /var/lib/qubes/appvms/ 8. libxl logs for every(!!!) disposable VM ever run in this Qubes install in /var/log/libvirt/libxl/  9. qubes logs for every(!!!) disposable VM ever run in this Qubes install in /var/log/qubes/ 10. xen console logs for every(!!!!) disposable VM ever run in this Qubes install in /var/log/xen/console/  Some finding related to files *containing* references to disposable VMs in dom0 (via disp_contents.txt): 1. Current and many historical disposable VM references are found in files in /run/udev/data/b253* files/nodes. 2. xfwm4*.state files in /home/admin/.cache/sessions/ contains *many references* to disposable VM *WINDOW TITLES* (application names, web site names, etc.) since the installation of the Qubes install (as well as current session). 3. .xsession-errors* in ~ reference many disposable VM names 4. /home/admin/.config/pulse/{guid}-stream-volumes.tdb a binary file appears to have 0..n matches on disp[0-9]. 5. /etc/lvm/backup/qubes_dom0 has current disp VM names plus some that weren't shutdown cleanly. 6. /etc/lvm/backup/qubes_dom0_* files have historical disp VM names. 7. /var/log/qubes/qubes.log* references historical disp VM names. 8. The systemd journal has a ton of historical disp VM references. 9. /var/lib/qubes/qubes.xml contains a lot of historical disp VM references. 10. /var/lib/backups/qubes/qubes*.xml contains a lot of historical disp VM references. 11. /var/lib/xen/userdata* contains a lot of historical disp VM references. 12. /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status contains a lot of historical disp VM references.   **Describe the solution you'd like** 1. Triage of types of data leaking into dom0. 2. Based on types of data, develop a Qubes policy on eliminating, reducing, cleaning or ignoring the leaked data. 3. Based on type/policy,  institute efforts to reduce the content stored into dom0 (at all vs. short term vs long term).  **Where is the value to a user, and who might that user be?** All users who may want the historical content of the disposable VM usage not to be memorialized. Journalists, security researchers, etc.  **Describe alternatives you've considered** None appear to cover 100% of use cases. Perhaps TAILS in an HVM might reduce it the most.  **Additional context**  **Relevant [documentation](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/) you've consulted**  **Related, [non-duplicate](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/reporting-bugs/#new-issues-should-not-be-duplicates-of-existing-issues) issues** #3504 (similar, but does not provide a focus on specific leakage into dom0) #4408 (anti-forensics on swap files only) #1819 (anti-forensics request only covers the block devices for the VM) #1293 (similar to 1819) #3360 (specific to dom0 logging only) #2024 (emulating Tails' approach, dom0 leakage still possible) ",,

User feedback:  > Contributors who wish to remain anonymous should have their contributions show up without attribution. It shouldn’t create a user whose name is anonymous. It shouldn’t bind all their contributions together. And it shouldn’t be possible to find those contributions by adding their email address.  There does not appear to be an anonymous option in the new Contribution flow, which is probably better because it doesn't promise anonymity without ensuring it. But we still have a responsibility to people who donated and checked the anonymous box previously.  When users inquire, we tell them to create a pseudonymous separate account if they don't want a donation associated with their identity. Is this the best approach going forward?",,
https://api.github.com/repos/openaustralia/planningalerts/issues/1344,405025165,Add privacy protecting share count for non tracking social share buttons,"In #1316 we're replacing the default twitter and facebook share buttons by simple links that do not send any information to twitter or facebook unless the user actively shares on one of those platforms.  However, this does not show how often the page was shared on facebook which the default button shows.  The facebook graph api provides functionality to get the share counts. This is implemented on theyvoteforyou in https://github.com/openaustralia/publicwhip/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/shareCount.js. However, there is a significant problem with that implementation. So, we don't want to copy it as is. If we use javascript to call the facebook graph api we're still sending a web request to facebook and it's possible that they use this track users. In fact Firefox, with content blocking enabled, will block this request anyway.  What would be better is if the server proxies requests to the share count api for the client. That why the server effectively anonymizes the data so facebook can't figure out who made the call. There could be issues with quotas and authorisation so this might not be trivial so we'll see. ",,

In principle it's possible to create a scheme where:  * The members of the group agree on a commitment to the roster / tree instead of the objects themselves * Each Handshake message includes the information necessary to update the commitment * ... and a proof of the signer's inclusion in the roster, relative to the current roster commitment  For example, if the roster were committed as a Merkle tree root, an Add message could come with (1) an inclusion proof for the signer's public key, relative to the prior tree root; and (2) a consistency proof between the prior tree root and the updated root.  This would open up a spectrum of options for how much state the clients have to cache (note that the client has to cache its direct path in any case, to be able to decrypt TreeKEM encryptions).  The current draft would be on one end, with clients storing everything.  The other end would have clients store nothing and handshake messages just carrying new entropy and updating commitments.  As an example of an intermediate state, if you assume that Updates are more common than Adds/Removes, you could require each client to cache its own copath.  Then Add/Remove/Update messages would have to provide enough information about the tree to allow the other clients to update their copaths (in addition to updating the commitments). ",,

This change coalesces the two errors, making an unknown payment hash error indistinguishable from the case wherein an intermediate node modifies the value of the final HTLC. Otherwise, if this isn't patched, then a node can probe the final destination of an HTLC as the node that returns `FinalIncorrectHtlcAmount` reveals that the know the payment hash pre-image, but the value is incorrect.

WWW'17,"# Contribution: This paper recognizes a novel privacy ploblem in publishing mobility data and proves that even publishing aggregated mobility data could lead to privacy breach in individuals' trajectories.  # Advantages: 1. They have two key findings:     1. Each user has a coherent mobility trajectory.     2. Individual mobility is significantly different across different users, and most of them are unique.  2. They design different cost matrix for nighttime, daytime and accross days 3. Experimental results on two real datasets show good performance by using their methods. 4. They evaluate the impact of different factors like spatial resolution, temporal resolution and number of users.  5.

https://api.github.com/repos/dtr-org/unit-e/issues/210,377931086,Feature: Dandelion-lite,"Just had a discussion with @AM5800 and @amiller about a possible alternative Dandelion implementation, which we call Dandelion-lite. Summary of 3 candidate approaches below:  **(1) Dandelion** Described in detail in [BIP 156](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0156.mediawiki).  _Pros:_ - Strong privacy guarantees (for a routing algorithm) - Relatively lightweight (adds a few seconds of latency for a stem length of ~10)  _Cons:_ - Somewhat high complexity, especially for orphan transactions, RBF, etc - Analysis does not cover what happens when a Dandelion route is changed - Latency may be too high for Unit-e given focus on speed  **(2) Dandelion-lite** The stem phase lasts only 1 hop before fluffing. Each node keeps track of only its own transactions that were sent to a dandelion relay, and starts an embargo timer for each such transaction. A note describing the protocol and analysis can be found [here](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gfanti/dandelion-lite.pdf).  _Pros:_ - Simpler than Dandelion (no need for orphan handling) - Privacy guarantees are similar to Dandelion when the adversary knows the graph (see linked document for analysis) - Lower latency than Dandelion since stem phase is only 1 hop  _Cons:_  - More complex than doing nothing - Worse privacy than Dandelion when the adversary does not know the graph  **Diffusion** This is what is done now: send to each peer with independent exponential delays.  _Pros:_ - Already implemented  - Lowest latency of the 3 options  _Cons:_  - Poor privacy guarantees   We are currently leaning towards Dandelion-lite due to the simplicity of implementation, relatively low latency, and the fairly good privacy guarantees (compared to full Dandelion). I will also run some simulations on diffusion and upload them here so we can get a numeric comparison. Thoughts/comments welcome.",,

https://api.github.com/repos/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3994,332312234,"change Qubes network policy, UpdatesProxy to network disabled by default for better leak-proofness","### Qubes OS version: R4 and above ### Affected component(s):  dom0, Whonix ### Steps to reproduce the behavior: Set NetVM of anon-whonix to default (sys-net).  Then use system default networking `curl.anondist-orig https://check.torproject.org` or otherwise to connect to clearnet. ### Expected behavior: Secure defaults. No clearnet connections possible through small user configuration mistake / oversight. ### Actual behavior: Insecure defaults. Clearnet leak. ### General notes: Qubes UpdatesProxy mechanism currently is more likely to produce a leak in future. A leak as in a user expecting to have connections torified while these are over clearnet.  The problem is, that https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin/blob/master/qubes-rpc-policy/qubes.UpdatesProxy.policy by default says `$type:TemplateVM $default allow,target=sys-net`. And sys-net traffic isn't torified by default. Therefore, if any of the following goes wrong (salt / tags / qvm-features maybe / qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix), Whonix TemplateVMs might connect through clearnet. Would be better if `qubes.UpdatesProxy.policy` only included `$anyvm $anyvm deny` and then opt-in each and every TemplateVM rather than an opt-out approach.  When the user wants torification, the default non-torification setting needs to be overwritten. This is done by salt:  * https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-mgmt-salt-dom0-virtual-machines/blob/master/qvm/template-whonix-gw.sls - which depends on `tag:whonix-updatevm` * https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-mgmt-salt-dom0-virtual-machines/blob/master/qvm/updates-via-whonix.sls  And then there is also https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix.  The user accidentally setting a whonix-ws based AppVM such as anon-whonix to NetVM default (sys-net) results in `curl.anondist-orig https://check.torproject.org` being able to reach it over clearnet. This is a huge disadvantage over the VirtualBox version of Whonix where such mistakes are very very unlikely to happen. (Because the Whonix-Workstation VirtualBox version of Whonix has only an internal network card (in internal network `whonix`) - which cannot accidentally connect to clearnet.)  ----  Qubes-Whonix has code to detect wrongly configured Qubes updates proxy settings and refuses to upgrade but that's just a workaround and more complexity (possible including bugs leading to situations where users cannot upgrade or false-positive warnings).  * https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/blob/master/etc/uwt.d/40_qubes.conf * https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/blob/master/usr/lib/qubes-whonix/init/torified-updates-proxy-check * https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/qubes-whonix-torified-updates-proxy-check.service  There's also `whonixcheck --leak-tests`.  It's not a real fix, not as strong as a technical guarantee as it could be.  ----  It's a complex design and interaction. Hard to fully understand (more so the more time passes). Prone for bugs in future or user mistake.  In summary, Qubes default and technical design currently is: network-enabled, clearnet, options to change to network-disabled or torified  For better control of connections the technical design should be: non-networked by default and then opt-in networking by using salt / core-admin-addon's.

Cool.  Shivan has pointed out that this attribute could be more granular, and that ongoing work in Feature Policy would provide a more specific delegation of permission. For example, a site might want to indicate that the embedded iframe should be able to access the camera, but not the user's microphone.

There are some nice privacy advantages to using this model of user-directed input for camera access and it's nice to see that reflected in the HTML spec.  The capture attribute is defined in the [html-media-capture](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-media-capture/) specification. Implementors should note the requirements on user agents defined in that specification have security and privacy implications.  The grammar is a little ambiguous here, but it sounds like this is intended to parse as ""implementors should note `that` the requirements on user agents have security and privacy implications"".   The Media Capture spec's Security and privacy considerations section is non-normative; it explicitly doesn't add those as normative requirements on the UA. Perhaps it should; the advice about stripping invisible, sensitive metadata (the example is EXIF data, which might include geolocation) seems especially important.  There are privacy implications to other requirements in that spec. For example, the UA is forbidden from saving captured media to storage, which seems like a privacy advantage, although I could imagine some abuse or violation of user preferences from that requirement.  Is this just a general reminder to implementers that they should consider security and privacy when implementing this other specification? Could we provide something more substantive or is the group just looking to hint at unspecified privacy implications?",,

In my quick checks on current versions of Chrome and Safari on Mac OS clicking on links from a google.com search results page, I couldn't determine that secondary requests were being sent in the background short of opening the network inspector and observing HTTP POST requests. I trust that we don't believe that is ""clear to the user"".

Indeed, this might be a step backward in transparency for end users, who in some cases now can no longer use the status bar to observe that they're being redirected through a tracking link, and might conclude that tracking isn't happening, that they're navigating to a site by clicking a link without any background communications. In neither browser I tested could I find a setting to disable sending these background requests, as was proposed as an advantage of the feature. > >If implementers believe that the clarity requirement is actually unnecessary and that it's still better for user privacy, that would be a separate question to discuss.

This issue is to track how, ~~or if I should~~, attempt to create such a thing.

https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13298,325024786,Net: Bucketing INV delays (1 bucket) for incoming connections to hide tx time,It has been brought up to my attention that current random delays mechanism (originally intended to obfuscate transaction metadata) allows to easily estimate the time a transaction was received by a node.  It may be done by connecting multiple observer nodes to the same node. Each of those nodes will generate its own schedule of delays. Combined metadata regarding those events from different sources allows an observer to estimate transaction time.  After this patch a spy won't gain additional information by just creating multiple connections to a target.,,
https://api.github.com/repos/eyedeekay/si-i2p-plugin/issues/2,322737885,Other attacks?,"So I've pretty much successfully broken the cryptographic connection between a visits to separate eepSites. But less reliable forms of linkability are still possible. This issue is to keep track of what those attacks are and whether the proxy will be able to do anything about them. I'll add them as I hear about/understand them:  **""Classic"" fingerprinting**  Fingerprinting techniques using Javascript are pretty well known, I won't waste time here.   1. Is it something that can be fixed? Probably better to think of it like an arms race rather than a problem to be solved for now. Browsers are complicated AF. Pessimism is a perfectly fair position. In terms of the arms-race stance, though, the tool to use is the Tor Browser Bundle, modified to use non-tor proxies. 2. Does it lead to identification? Kinda. It fails to de-obfuscate the location of the user, but it's capable of gathering so much information about a person's computer that it can be pretty unique.  **Addressbook Fingerprinting**  Currently, it's probably possible to tell whether a readable address is in the local addressbook. If that's true, then it's possible that an addressbook may be unique enough to be personally identifiable. If that's true, then it defeats the purpose of this software. I need to find a way to make this information useless.  Eventually, jumphelper will fix this, but it needs a LOT of work. Jumphelper also needs the interstitial 'add to book' page, and it [also needs](https://geti2p.net/spec/proposals/135-authenticated-address-helpers.txt)  **Attacks on the control interfaces:**  Right now the primary interface for granular control is the pipe system, but since it's path-based, there's the possibility that a malicious URL could be used to inject something into someplace it shouldn't be(i.e. use a malicously crafted URL to retrieve content overtop of a ""send"" pipe). In order to fix this, pipe interface names should be reserved, and replaced transparently before they can do damage. A resolution I think will work is now in place.  1. I'm pretty sure I fixed it.  2. It should be resolved.  Besides this, I have planned a disk-avoidance mode which will disable the pipe system entirely in favor of the control port emulator.  **Request Timing Attacks:**  Using a similar network of colluding sites as the one used to correlate i2p destinations, make a request from one site to a resource from another site. Record the time. Requests close in time are likely to have come from the same user, especially on sites with very little traffic.  1. Is it something that can be fixed? Maybe. One partial solution is to tear-down tunnels to a particular eepSite after X minutes without a request. That way, an attacker has to keep a connection open to create reliable longitudinal data. Of course, that's simple enough, just keep requesting resources from that site. Another partial solution would be to intercept requests to off-eepSite resources and inject a random delay before sending the request. That would make it harder to correlate third-party requests to an individual user if a site has sufficient traffic. Unfortunately, there's no way to determine how long to make the delay that I can see because it depends on the traffic to the eepSite. In combination, these are probably worth doing even if they can't fix the issue completely. Besides that, it's an argument for TorButton integration which I'd been considering anyway(Use new circuit for this site or whatever).  It would also be possible to use a unique dynamic URL for the same correlation(i.e. send the destination of the requester in the URL of the request). This is definitely damn-near impossible to fix, except maybe if I scrub it out of requests, but then it's still possible to do with any other unpredictable piece of data. I could make this unproductive by making all cross-site requests appear to be from the destination of the page including the resource request, but as far as I can tell, it's a break-even prospect and would involve more work on my part. 2. Does it lead to identification? Not reliably in most circumstances, AFAICT. It leads to suspicion, it can probably be used to profile, but it neither de-obfuscates a user's location nor links them to a very unique piece of data. Moreover, the more people using an eepSite, the less likely such an attack is to indicate anything useful.  **Requests for local resources:**  These types of attacks have, traditionally, been mitigated in browsers rather than in proxies, and using TBB will fix this. Still though, I would like to explore whether it would be worthwhile to try and ""Strip"" malicious requests for say, an image in the i2p router's admin panel out of pages before they reach the browser, or offer some kind of warning?  1. Is it something that can be fixed? Yes, use TBB(more accurately, disable un-proxied requests to the localhost in any browser, but TBB does this automatically). This is simply exploratory. 2. Does it lead to identification? Not usually, but I bet it can.  ",,
https://api.github.com/repos/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3895,322549194,Improve data collection practices,"From https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc/pull/649#discussion_r187784320: > We keep the log for both statistics and audit reasons. I'm not sure how long we keep them, but I think at least 2 months, but in any case the statistics script does not touch logs older than 3 months. >  > The log is kept unencrypted and that includes IP addresses. They are looked at by human only in case of audit/postmortem (this happened at least once).  I think it's very important that we improve our practices in this area. Thankfully, we don't have to handle much data about users, but with respect to the data about users that we *do* handle, we should: 1. Set clear written policies for data access and retention. 2. Publish those policies publicly (see #1624). 3. Store the data securely (e.g., encrypt the IP addresses and/or store only hashes of them). 4. Ensure that only the minimum required number of authorized personnel are allowed access to the data, and keep logs of that access. 5. Securely destroy the data as soon as it's no longer needed (e.g., after we're done calculating the userbase estimate for each month, or as soon as our auditing requirements allow).  I'm assigning this to the ""Documentation/website"" milestone, but this primarily applies to the data we collect from the Qubes update servers. Since we don't host the Qubes website ourselves, we don't have any access to or control over the data generated when people visit the website.  CC: @rootkovska, @marmarek, @woju, @mfc ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/1222,321789923,"routing: add shadow route randomization, payment path randomization, and fee randomization","It's possible to improve the heuristical privacy of payments originating at an `lnd` node by adding a degree of padding and randomization to each of the payments we send. The three areas that we can apply padding and randomization are: shadow routes, payment path randomization, and fee randomization.   We can add padding in the form of time locks (called shadow routes) to further obfuscate the ultimate destination of a payment from an intermediate node. Observe that if a node receives a payment, and the outgoing timelock isn't very far off from the current height plus the CLTV delta of the next node, then the payment is likely destined for that node. To combat this, we can add ""shadow"" routes in the form of an additional timelock used offset from the final CLTV delta of the final node. The shadow routes may be a static value, but ideally we leverage the existing graph to create a shadow extension route and accumulate that additional CLTV to the entire route.   We can also add a degree of randomization when selecting _which_ edge to traverse next during path finding. This would come in the orm of randomizing the weight of an edge during the relaxation phase.   Finally, we can randomize the amount that we send (adhering to the % based fee limit) in order to further obsfucate repeated payments of the same size.   # Steps To Completion   - [ ] After we find the set of candidate paths, but _before_ we map the [_paths_ to _routes_](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/routing/pathfind.go#L244), a new route selection should be kicked off that looks for paths from the destination to other nods within a few hops. The additional CLTV value of this new path should then be passed in as the `finalCLTVDelta` of each of the calls to `newRoute`.   - [ ] The [`edgeWeight`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/routing/pathfind.go#L423) function should be modified to take a `rand.Reader` and to extract a random value. This value should then be added to the intermediate weight. This will serve to randomize of selection of edges to ensure that a query from us to Carol doesn't always traverse the exact same set of edges (ignoring `missionControl`).   - [ ] When we're selecting the size of the payment to send, we should take into account the max fee % and add an additional amount of satoshis (in a randomized manner) for the _total_ payment sent. This will result in us overpaying the destination at times (up to the max allotted fee % deviation). ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12457,297903229,Implement bip69 (Lexicographical Indexing of Transaction Inputs and Outputs),"[BIP69](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) is a pretty under appreciated bip that defines a standard ordering for transactions inputs / outputs.  There's quite a few obvious advantages to the approach, like making it easy to verify correctness, or making it easier to write unit tests. But I think the most important aspect is it helps users verify their wallet isn't maliciously leaking information. Granted a malicious wallet could try leak information via the nonces, deterministic signing helps make that detectible with access to the private keys.  As some wallets have already moved to bip69 (and unlikely to consider moving back) it would be very beneficial if core moves in the same direction resulting in better transaction uniformity for everyone.   (And a bounty for fun: if this is merged in the next 3 months I'll offer 0.03 BTC to the author :D)",,

XVZ deployed a private contract for ABC node. LPV is not in the private party. Following is the contract code:  `contract SamplePrivateContract{     uint public value;     function setValue(uint newValue)public {         value = newValue;     }     function getValue()constant public returns(uint){         return value;     } }`  Contract at XVZ node was deployed by giving public key of ABC node.  Invoked contract methods at ABC, XVZ and LPV nodes using  contract address and contract abi.  Following are the steps which were performed   Step 1)  XVZ Node ---> setValue(125) , privateFor[ABC.pub]  Result --->   XVZ ---> getValue() = 125.                   ABC ---> getValue() = 125.                    LPV ---> getValue() = 0.  Step 2)  ABC Node ---> setValue(126) , privateFor[XVZ.pub]  Result --->   XVZ ---> getValue() = 126.                   ABC ---> getValue() = 126.                    LPV ---> getValue() = 0.  Step 3)  LPV Node ---> setValue(127) , privateFor[ABC.pub]  (This should have given an error. But it was executed successfully and gave txId.  Private ledger state was changed  in ABC node.)  Result --->   XVZ ---> getValue() = 126.                   ABC ---> getValue() = 127.                    LPV ---> getValue() = 0.  Step 4)  LPV Node ---> setValue(128) , privateFor[XVZ.pub]  (This should have given an error. But it was executed successfully and gave txId. Private ledger state was changed  in XVZ node.)  Result --->   XVZ ---> getValue() = 128.                   ABC ---> getValue() = 127.                    LPV ---> getValue() = 0.  I thought steps 3 and 4 should not have been successful. As LPV node is not involved in the private party.  But LPV node was able to change the state of contract variable, And ABC node and XVZ node private ledger had different values.    #### System information  Geth version: `geth version`  `Version: 1.5.0-unstable`  OS & Version: Windows/Linux/OSX  `Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS`  #### Expected behaviour `It should throw error`  #### Actual behaviour Successfully invokes the contract method and gives transaction id.   #### Steps to reproduce the behaviour  Set up three nodes by name ABC, XVZ and LPV.

https://api.github.com/repos/ConsenSys/quorum/issues/256,287614860,Events emitted in Private Transactions are not present in the transaction receipt logs,"#### System information  Geth version: ` 1.7.2-stable-0905eda4`  (`Geth/v1.7.2-stable-0905eda4/linux-amd64/go1.9.2`)  OS & Version: Linux `Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS`  Branch, Commit Hash or Release: ` HEAD detached at v2.0.0 nothing to commit, working directory clean`  #### Expected behaviour Events logged/emitted from a Private transaction are retrieved when recalling the transaction receipt. E.g. `eth.getTransactionReceipt(tHash)` In relation to the test contract below the expected behaviour is * Event is present in the logs when recalling the transaction receipt * Callback function called when watching the event * `invocation` is incremented.  #### Actual behaviour The logs are empty when recalling the transaction receipt for a Private Contract and Private transaction. The transaction succeeds and state is updated in the contract. In relation to the test contract below the expected behaviour is: * [Fail] Event is present in the logs when recalling the transaction receipt * [Pass] Callback function called when watching the event * [Pass] `invocation` is incremented.  #### Summary of testing performed A test contract `EventEmitter.sol` was created. This contract is a simple contract that emits and event and increments a counter. ``` contract EventEmitter {     event ContractEvent(string payload);      uint public invocations;       function EventEmitter() {      }      function RaiseEvent(string payload) {         ContractEvent(payload);         invocations++;     }  } ``` Tested under `Raft` and `Istanbul` consensus and for each `solc` version 0.3.6, 0.4.8, 0.4.18 (the behaviour below was consistent) 1. Deploy the contract without `privateFor` and send transaction without `privateFor` - this works as expected.  * [Pass] Event is present in the logs when recalling the transaction receipt  * [Pass] Callback was called when watching the event in geth * [Pass] `invocation` was incremented. 2. Deploy the contract with `privateFor` and send transaction without `privateFor` - Failed. Occasionally this killed the geth/constellation process of the sender and recipient – this was random and I can’t reliably repro it. * [Fail] Event is present in the logs when recalling the transaction receipt * [Fail] Callback was not called when watching the event in geth * [Fail] `invocation` was not incremented. 3. Deploy the contract with `privateFor` and send transaction with `privateFor` - Partial success. * [Fail] Event is present in the logs when recalling the transaction receipt * [Pass] Callback was called when watching the event in geth * [Pass] `invocation` was not incremented.    #### Steps to reproduce the behaviour 1. Deploy `EventEmitter` contract with `privateFor` 2.`sendTransaction` with `privateFor` for `RaiseEvent` 3.`eth.getTransactionReceipt(tHash)` 4.The logs are not populated.

Create service that unsets or readonly's and then exports QREXEC_SERVICE_ARGUMENT (and QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN) before launching processes.  ### Expected behavior: <!-- Type below this line. -->  For services redirected in dom0 and targeted in the 'client' domain to itself, QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN is not leaked to the 'server' domain at all.  Environment variables that are passed to the 'server' but are then either unset or readonly-overwritten by the service script are either not present in launched processes' environment or replaced with the overwritten values. i.e. these values are inherited by processes launched in the service script from the service script.  ### Actual behavior: <!-- Type below this line. -->  For redirected services, QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN is leaked to the 'server' domain  Even when QREXEC_SERVICE_ARGUMENT (and QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN) is unset or overwritten read-only in the service script before a processes is launched is set in the process's environment.  ### General notes: <!-- Type below this line. -->  I have mostly replaced IP in my template (Gentoo) and sys-whonix using socat chains and qrexec with the aim of removing IP from the kernels of all domains behind one locked down proxy in front of sys-whonix that acts as its ip. The final three problems are: that control-port-filter-python does not work on tunneled unix sockets, for which I would appreciate @adrelanos's help, though socket_wrapper looks promising as a workaround; the second is that I do not have the knowledge necessary to adjust sys-whonix's firewall for a separate domain (which only @adrelanos could do safely); and the third, which is the problem I am reporting, is that nomatter how many times I try to hide QREXEC* from anything launched from my service in the 'server' domain, they end up in every process's environment.  At the moment I'm hashing a secret that lasts as long as the service in the 'client' and sending the hash and an indication of when the client's session is over as QREXEC_SERVICE_ARGUMENT.  The service has a temporary list of mapped hashes to sockets that are configured by Tor. When the service is called without ""-shutdown"" in QREXEC_SERVICE_ARGUMENT, it checks first whether the list exists. If it doesn't, it generates a secret and records it. It then hashes that secret with the hash sent by the client. It unsets QREXEC_SERVICE_ARGUMENT (and QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN) and randomly selects an available socket, then records hash(hash+secret) in the mapping.  When the hash is not in that mapping, a new ""session"" is created by creating a secret, hashing QREXEC_SERVICE_ARGUMENT with that secret, and recording both the secret and hash(hash+secret) in the list. If the list already exists, the secret is read and the mapping derived from hash(hash+secret). With -shutdown, the mapping is removed. If it's the last mapping, the secret is removed too.  Thus, anything without ptrace of qubes-rpc-multiplexer or the service script should not be able to learn the true mapping. The client service is protected with SELinux and grsecurity RBAC, while the server is protected with AppArmor, setcaps and unshare. Both have hidepid=2. Most of /proc and all of /sys are hidden in the client, but not the 'server' as AppArmor does not provide for hiding objects.  When moving to add openssl to the socat chain so as to both gain zero knowledge passwords and protect Xen from malicious fuzzing or magic sequences, I discovered that my current scheme was a little useless due to sys-whonix learning QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN and further completely useless as socat learns both QREXEC_SERVICE_ARGUMENT and QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN.  I would be very grateful if you could fix this for R3.2 as I will not have the time to either migrate or port to R4.0 for several months.  ---  #### Related issues: <!-- Type below this line. -->  Generally, a great deal of information  is non-optionally leaked about the system through qubesdb and qrexec. It would be nice if this could be configured with per-domain or per-template configuration to either: not send; spoof with specific values; or randomly select between commonly seen sets of values.

https://api.github.com/repos/ConsenSys/quorum/issues/156,246651641,issue with private contract deployment with the factory model,"#### System information Quorum version : 1.1.0  #### Scenario Facing problem while creating the contract in a private way using the factory contract. I have two contracts SampleContractFactory and SampleContract. SampleContractFactory provides a function to create the SampleContract instance. Deployment : Step 1. SampleContractFactory is deployed as an private contract from Node1 to Node2, Node3, Node4, Node 5. Step 2. From Node2, Factory contract function CreateSampleContract() is called as private to Node1. New contract gets deployed at address say 0xXXXX at Node1 & Node2. Till now results are as expected. Step 3. From Node3, Factory contract function CreateSampleContract() is called as private to Node1.  Now new contract is getting deployed at address 0xXXXX at Node 3 and 0xYYYYY at Node1.   #### Expected Behavior : New contract should get deployed at  0xYYYYY at Node3 and Node1. #### Actual Behaviour : New contract is getting deployed at different addresses.     #### Steps to reproduce the behaviour   Solidity smart contract code is   contract SampleContract {     uint counter;     function SampleContract(uint i){         counter = i;     } }  import ""./SampleContract.sol""; contract SampleContractFactory {     address[] addresses;     function SampleContractFactory(){  }     function CreateSampleContract(){         SampleContract ob = new SampleContract(10);         addresses.push(address(ob));     }     function getSampleContract(uint index) constant returns (address _sampleContract){         return addresses[index];     }  }  Looking at the behavior I think the nounce of the Factory contract that is one of the factor to calculate the new contract address is getting different at different nodes causing this inconsistency.

If that is the wanted behavior, the return value should probably be an empty string when function is returning a string.

As not all users will want to, or be able to advetise a publicly routed IP address, support for Tor hidden services should be integrated into the daemon. In addition to solving a slew of NAT issues, Tor hidden services also hide the location of the advertising `lnd` node, and make the system much more private when in us.   The Tor control port should be used to detect a local Tor daemon, and automatically set up an hidden service which `lnd` will use as its sole listening interface (if specified by a command line option).

One local repo in my computer pushes to two remotes  - branch master pushes to a pubic remote repository,    ```bash git push -u https://github.com/forestgeo/test.git master ```  - branch master-private pushes to a private remote repository,    ```bash git push -u https://github.com/forestgeo/test-private.git master-private ```  The commands above where used only the first time each branch pushed. Because I used `-u`, next I push from any branch simply with:  ```bash git push ```",,

As dhclient doesn't have persistent storage, this procedure is performed at each boot. This results in leaking time value that is represented in seconds since midnight (UTC), January 1, 2000, modulo 2^32.  Consequences: 1. Security: leak of system boot time may help with some kinds of attacks. For example, it may be used to help guessing seeds of some random number generators (e.g. simple ones that use time to seed themselves).  2. Privacy: this leak may be used to identify Qubes system in a network - its time part in DUID-LLT will very often be close to current time, unlike other systems.  tcpdump from sys-net (second part of MAC is spoofed, oui part is hidden as XX:YY:ZZ): ``` 09:43:45.380378 EAPOL key (3) v2, len 117 09:43:45.380813 EAPOL key (3) v1, len 117 09:43:45.396282 EAPOL key (3) v2, len 151 09:43:45.404394 EAPOL key (3) v1, len 95 09:43:45.752094 IP6 (hlim 1, next-header Options (0) payload length: 36) :: > ff02::16: HBH (rtalert: 0x0000) (padn) [icmp6 sum ok] ICMP6, multicast listener report v2, 1 group record(s) [gaddr ff02::1:ff50:9af1 to_ex { }] 09:43:46.048415 IP (tos 0x10, ttl 128, id 0, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 328)     0.0.0.0.bootpc > 255.255.255.255.bootps: [udp sum ok] BOOTP/DHCP, Request from XX:YY:ZZ:50:9a:f1 (oui Unknown), length 300, xid 0x2e1b1036, Flags [none] (0x0000)   Client-Ethernet-Address XX:YY:ZZ:50:9a:f1 (oui Unknown)   Vendor-rfc1048 Extensions     Magic Cookie 0x63825363     DHCP-Message Option 53, length 1: Discover     Parameter-Request Option 55, length 18:       Subnet-Mask, BR, Time-Zone, Classless-Static-Route       Domain-Name, Domain-Name-Server, Hostname, YD       YS, NTP, MTU, Option 119       Default-Gateway, Classless-Static-Route, Classless-Static-Route-Microsoft, Static-Route       Option 252, NTP     Client-ID Option 61, length 19: hardware-type 255, ZZ:50:9a:f1:00:01:00:01:1f:d5:50:52:XX:YY:ZZ:50:9a:f1 ```  Time is encoded here as 1f:d5:50:52, that corresponds to ~16.9 years since 2000 (yestarday).  ### Expected behavior: For systems without persistent storage DUID-LL should be used; this is very similar to DUID-LLT but does not include time - [rfc-3315], section 9.4. [rfc-4361], sections 6.1, 6.2 also basically confirms [rfc-3315].  Note: alternative solution, adding persistent storage for DUID in sys-net will break MAC randomization feature as this will expose MAC as part of DUID.  ### Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Boot into Qubes 2. Disconnect network in sys-net (if connected) 3. Start tcpdump in sys-net, e.g. ""tcpdump -i wlp0s0 -vv > dump1.txt"" (replace interface name with your own) 4. Connect to some wireless network (using NetworkManager applet) 5. Stop tcpdump in sys-net 6. Reboot (can just shutdown all dependent VMs and reboot sys-net) 7. Repeat steps 1-5, using dump2.txt 8. Compare dump1.txt and dump2.txt - see the difference in Client-ID part  ### References [rfc-3315] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315 [rfc-4361] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4361 ",,

This profiles directory contains a Google tracking cookie called `PREF`.  This cookie is well-known to be the cookie that NSA was using to track users uniquely using their mass surveillance selectors, but now the cookie has been deprecated.  Two other sites have left cookies in that surprise Firefox profile: `stats.webtrendslive.com` and `mozilla.org`.  **The cookies are marked to be transmitted over plain HTTP**.  The Firefox cache is also not empty.  Finally, there are a number of settings and other SQLite databases there.  I am pretty sure they have not been vacuumed, so whichever browser cache and history that was when the `tbz` file was constructed, that exact same profile has been the profile that everyone using Qubes DispVM uses.  There are numerous other personal dotfile settings that are stored in the `tbz` file in question.  Frankly, I do not know how `/etc/dispvm-dotfiles.tbz` came to be, but I am shocked to have discovered this.  The DispVM ought to boot with exactly zero customizations from a `/etc/skel` home directory.  I find no rationale for the contents of the `tbz` file anywhere.  I donno what to think. ",,

https://api.github.com/repos/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2361,180878196,Explore local network privacy solutions beyond MAC address randomization,"In our issue on MAC randomization (#938), @adrelanos [shared](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/938#issuecomment-231118785) a recent research paper by Vanhoef et al., [""Why MAC Address Randomization is not Enough: An Analysis of Wi-Fi Network Discovery Mechanisms.""](http://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/asiaccs2016.pdf)  @tasket then [recommended](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/938#issuecomment-251198637) that a new issue be created for the problem raised by this research.  Abstract:   > We present several novel techniques to track (unassociated) > mobile devices by abusing features of the Wi-Fi standard. This shows > that using random MAC addresses, on its own, does not guarantee privacy. > First, we show that information elements in probe requests can be used > to fingerprint devices. We then combine these fingerprints with > incremental sequence numbers, to create a tracking algorithm that does > not rely on unique identifiers such as MAC addresses. Based on > real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm can correctly > track as much as 50% of devices for at least 20 minutes. We also show > that commodity Wi-Fi devices use predictable scrambler seeds. These can > be used to improve the performance of our tracking algorithm. Finally, > we present two attacks that reveal the real MAC address of a device, > even if MAC address randomization is used. In the first one, we create > fake hotspots to induce clients to connect using their real MAC address. > The second technique relies on the new 802.11u standard, commonly > referred to as Hotspot 2.0, where we show that Linux and Windows send > Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) requests using their real MAC address.

https://api.github.com/repos/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1941,152516806,Qubes VPN documentation limitations,"a) [Qubes VPN documentation](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vpn/) afaik does not fail closed. If the VPN breaks down, connections will still be possible in the clear. Which most likely is not what most users want since they want assurance the VPN will always be used.  b) Qubes VPN documentation is not suited to hide Tor. It does not claim it is, but using VPNs to hide Tor is something users often have in mind. (I infer this from the many questions about it from the Whonix forums.) This is because if a Tor entry guard is running on the same server as the VPN server, and if VPN breaks down, Tor may connect directly to the VPN if it happened to choose that as entry guard. This is not that unlikely, because a lot VPN providers support VPN port forwarding, use public IPs and people host Tor servers behind VPN's.  Do we have tickets for a) and b)?  In meanwhile should we list these limitations (and link to the tickets) from the documentation? ",,

Its very high accuracy poses a serious threat to anonymous users.[1]  This tracking technology has been deployed by major advertisers (Google, Facebook), banks and massive online courses. Its also happening at a massive scale because just using an interactive JS application in presence of a network adversary that records all traffic allows them to construct biometric models for virtually everyone (think Google suggestions) even if the website does not record these biometric stats itself.[2] They have this data from everyone's clearnet browsing and by comparing this to data exiting the Tor network they will unmask users.  As a countermeasure security researcher Paul Moore created a prototype Chrome plugin known as KeyboardPrivacy. It works by caching keystrokes and introducing a random delay before passing them on to a webpage.[3] Unfortunately there is no source code available for the add-on and the planned Firefox version has not surfaced so far. There are hints that the author wants to create a closed hardware solution that implements this which does not help our cause.

https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7123,119284396,"[WIP] Make trickle logic useful again, delay trickle when past upload limit.","These change should improve privacy, discourage some resource  wasting behavior from parties trying to attack user privacy, and  provides additional node bandwidth control.  When Bitcoin Core was changed to not use fixed sleeps in network  message handling this mostly broke the trickle logic:  Instead of  picking a new random node to bypass the delay every 100ms, it now  chooses a new one every time through the message processing loop  which can be much faster and can be remotely triggered.  As a result a vast majority of invs simply blew through without  any delay.  This patch drops the old 1/4 random selection logic and elects two  trickle peers which will get immediate forwards.  These peers  are selected at random from the top four peers ordered by their  ability to take unfiltered relays, being outbound, being  network nodes, and highest uptime.  All other peers have their  INVs triggered on a shared random delay (with a mean of 1 second).  The selection criteria tries to find a stable set of non-attacker  controlled nodes that work and stick with them.  Two are used so that even if one was the original source of the  only transactions ready to send the transactions will not  be guaranteed to end their journey here.  It also should improve  robustness to dysfunctional nodes.  When the upload limit is passed, this responds by increasing the  batching interval by another second. Preliminary testing suggests  this significantly reduces the number of transaction getdatas  the node receives.  Finally, this sorts transaction INV before sending them to reduce  the potential for information to leak in INV ordering. ",,
https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7093,118712234,Address mempool information leak and resource wasting attacks.,Currently an attacker can poll mempool frequently to bypass  trickling logic and trace a transaction through the network.  This also wastes lots of bandwidth by causing the same huge  invs to be sent over and over.  This change makes mempool not return results with an arrival  time greater than the current minus 16 rounded down to a  multiple of 16 seconds. This is a 16 to 32 second delay.  It also makes mempool calls return only responses which have  not been INVed before (using the known inv mruset) and  limits the mempool command to considering only the top 8192  entries in the mempool. ,,

https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6586,102755022,"Automatically create hidden service, listen on Tor","Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically. https://stem.torproject.org/api/control.html#stem.control.Controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service  This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), bitcoin could automatically create a hidden service to listen on, without user manual configuration. That would positively affect the number of available .onion nodes.  This would involve the following, if enabled: - When the node is started, connect to Tor through control socket - Send `create_ephemeral_hidden_service` command - First time:   - Make it create a hidden service key   - Save the key in the data directory for later usage (optional: Could also use a new key every time. Better for privacy, less so for having stable identifiers, so this should be configurable) - Make it redirect port 8333 to the local port 8333 (or whatever port we're listening on). E.g.  ``` python response = controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service({8333: 8333}, key_type='NEW', key_content='BEST', await_publication = True) # Advertize <response.service_id>.onion # Optionally save response.private_key, response.private_key_type ``` - Keep control socket connection open for as long node is running. The hidden service will (by default) automatically go away when the connection is closed.  Challenges: - Except for experimentation we probably don't want to rely on a Python script. This means the `create_ephemeral_hidden_service` STEM interface has to be implemented in C++. Internal command is `ADD_ONION`,  see https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/commit/?id=f5ff369 for the appropriate addition to torspec.  Edit: the controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service will take a while (I suppose the reason is that it needs to generate a key) - maybe execute it in a thread and not in the main initialization.

Several applications such as Firefox with WebRTC support and BitTorrent clients leak the local IP address, so this can often be detected across the network in addition to within an exploited VM.  Instead, all VMs should use the most common local IP address in use (which I think should be either 192.168.1.2 or 192.168.1.128 with gateway 192.168.1.1, but some actual research should be done on this).  If the IP address conflicts with the numbering on a LAN the user wants to access, Qubes should allow to change the subnet: in this case it would be prudent to choose an address at random for each VM within the netmask specified by the user, to prevent correlation between VMs on the same host with non-default addressing (since detecting Qubes is going to be possible anyway on an exploited VM).  Firewall VMs should then NAT those addresses to an internal scheme such as 10.137.x.x (but I think 10.R.x.x where R is by default random and configurable is a better choice) so that internal networking and port forwarding can be supported.

This is bad for anonymity and unexpected.  Already discussed in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/qubes-devel/Q8h-RGH5YoA/fzWbi7c-kfoJ but there seems to be no open issue, and it's a critical issue at least for anonymous VMs.  Possible solutions: 1. Run all VMs in Xen PVHVM mode, fix libvirt so that it allows to set the CPUID for Xen and do so 2. Run all VMs in Xen PVH mode, fix Xen so that CPUID hiding works in PVH mode and fix libvirt as well to support PVH and allow to set CPUID 3. Replace Xen with KVM and then it just works with no additional effort  The CPUID chosen should be the default libvirt one for the physical CPU microarchitecture (i.e. one for Skylake, one for Haswell, one for Sandy Bridge, etc.) which allows using all CPU instruction set extensions while not giving any more information and should be changeable to a less featureful one (Core 2 or Athlon 64) for increased anonymity if desired.  Ideally Qubes should wait until a few months have passed from the release of a new CPU architecture before it starts advertising it by default, to ensure that the anonymity set is big enough, and it should also wait a random amount of time before changing it on upgrades, to avoid leaking the exact time the user installed the new CPU or changed computers.  It would also be nice to look at whether it's possible to prevent applications indirectly detecting the size of the cache, size of TLBs, the speed of the CPU and other characteristics, although it may not be practical to avoid those.

https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6568,101615947,Improve transaction privacy / fungibility in Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin system [meta tracking issues],"Financial privacy is an essential property of every monetary and payment system.  Without it the user's security is reduced due to targeted attacks, the freedom to associate and transact is limited, and their commercial interests may be compromised when competition can monitor their activity.  The importance of privacy was recognized in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, but the only approach available at the time (pseudonymous addresses) provides only limited privacy and what it does provide is highly brittle.  Advanced monitoring capabilities have substantially undermined this protection in practice, but at the same time technology has improved tremendously and we can now do much better than pseudonymous addresses.  Tightly linked to privacy is fungibility, an essential characteristic of a money like good.  When coins are overly distinguishable and people find themselves feeling obligated to consult (likely centralized) blacklists before accepting coins the utility of Bitcoin as a money is reduced.  Some people previously believed stronger privacy was incompatible with public auditability, but just like digital signatures prove your know your private key without disclosing it we know that privacy and public verification are not incompatible in a very fundamental sense.  Bitcoin Core should have a comprehensive plan to give users state of the art technology in this regard, but we must respect the challenges of deploying new technology in an already existing ecosystem.  Progress can be made in a series of larger and smaller initiatives.  This issue with track other issues and collect discussion related to the overall strategy on this front.

It is an important step toward addressing #3828.  This just adds the option `-walletbroadcast=<0,1>`. Right now with `-walletbroadcast=0` new transactions will get the status  ``` Status: conflicted, has not been successfully broadcast yet ```  ...which is a tad strange. This is just a visual issue, though, and goes away when the transaction is received through the network.  Edit: discussing with @gmaxwell on IRC we thought of a way to avoid this without arcane changes to conflict handling: keep track of the seen-the-network status of transactions internally.

Since iwlwifi devices are so popular with the business-class systems that seem to work well with Qubes, it makes sense to adopt this ""surefire"" MAC randomization strategy.  Most people who want Qubes probably also want MAC randomization.  Unless there's a more general solution, let's adopt this idea.  How much effort would it take to maintain this patch for iwlwifi?

Unless you own txins or txouts in the transaction.   So, you use the paper's techniques. But you can be much more speculative than they are, and get a low-likelihood but possible IP match for an address, connect your client up, and issue a transaction paying yourself and a small amount to the address you're interested in, just over the dust amount.  The transaction should be constructed so it's unlikely to be mined.  The transaction traverses the network, then it stops being rebroadcast, _except_ by the recipient and you. If your client is connected to the wallet that owns the address, it will see rebroadcasting for some time, providing a very strong link between the two.  This seems like a bad outcome.   I speculate that the 1Sochi transactions may have this motivation -- mapping addresses to determine IPs at large in Bitcoin.   It seems like the simplest thing would be to not re-re-broadcast to clients you've already spoken to, but I'll wait for smarter people than me to work out the right fix. ",,
